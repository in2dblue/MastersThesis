for		N	N
this		N	N
opportunity		N	C
to		N	N

somewhat		N	C
on		N	N
the		N	N

we		N	N
see		N	N
there		N	N

very		N	N
good		N	N
points		N	N

but		N	N
I		N	N
abstained		N	C

to		N	N
make		N	N
a		N	N
comment		N	N
on		N	N
Amendment		N	C
6		N	N
.		N	N

Right		N	N
from		N	N
the		N	N
beginning		N	N
,		N	N
we		N	N
have		N	N
taken		N	N
the		N	N
position		N	N
as		N	N
a		N	N
Parliament	0.267857142857143	C	C
-		N	N
including		N	N
the		N	N
Socialist		N	C
Group		N	N
-		N	N
that		N	N
we		N	N
treat		N	C
this		N	N
as		N	N
a		N	N
package		N	C
.		N	N

On		N	N
its		N	N
mission		N	C
,		N	N
Parliament	0.302631578947368	C	C
should		N	N
assess		N	C
the		N	N
effectiveness		N	C
of		N	N
that		N	N
support		N	N
.		N	N

So		N	N
Parliament	0.305555555555556	C	C
does		N	N
not		N	N
need		N	N
to		N	N
take		N	N
action		N	N
on		N	N
this		N	N
issue		N	N
.		N	N

For		N	N
this		N	N
reason		N	N
,		N	N
I		N	N
do		N	N
not		N	N
think		N	N
that		N	N
Parliament	0.3125	C	C
should		N	N
accept		N	C
that		N	N
the		N	N
Commissioner		N	C
made		N	N
a		N	N
statement		N	C
on		N	N
Echelon		N	C
.		N	N

Obviously		N	C
,		N	N
some		N	N
people		N	N
still		N	N
feel		N	N
upset		N	N
that		N	N
there		N	N
is		N	N
movement		N	C

Parliament	0.325	C	C

Finland		N	N

On		N	N

Communication		N	C

addressed		N	C
to		N	N
the		N	N
European		N	N
Parliament		N	C
and		N	N
the		N	N
Council		N	N
,		N	N
concerning		N	C
the		N	N
consequences		N	C
of		N	N
the		N	N
entry		N	N
into		N	N
force		N	N
of		N	N
the		N	N
Treaty		N	N
of		N	N

In		N	N
other		N	N
words		N	N
,		N	N
this		N	N
element		N	C
of		N	N
the		N	N
Treaty		N	N
of		N	N
Lisbon		N	N
,		N	N
frequently		N	N
mentioned		N	N
in		N	N
connection		N	N
with		N	N
the		N	N
expansion		N	C
of		N	N
Parliament		N	C
's		N	N
powers		N	N
,		N	N
namely		N	C
,		N	N
that		N	N
the		N	N
codecision		N	C
procedures	0.28571428571428603	C	C
have		N	N
increased		N	N
significantly		N	C
in		N	N
number		N	N
and		N	N
that		N	N
the		N	N
areas		N	N
in		N	N
which		N	N
Parliament		N	C
can		N	N
participate		N	C
have		N	N
expanded		N	C
,		N	N
represents		N	N
,		N	N
along		N	N
with		N	N
the		N	N
question		N	N
of		N	N
Parliament		N	C
's		N	N
power		N	N
of		N	N
legislative		N	C
delegation		N	C
,		N	N
not		N	N
only		N	N
a		N	N
quantitative		N	C
but		N	N
also		N	N
a		N	N
significant		N	C
qualitative		N	C
expansion		N	C
.		N	N

I		N	N
therefore		N	N
believe		N	N
that		N	N
the		N	N
procedures	0.35	C	C
for		N	N
mobilising		N	C
this		N	N
fund		N	N
should		N	N
be		N	N
streamlined		N	C
,		N	N
in		N	N
order		N	N
to		N	N
respond		N	N
quickly		N	N
to		N	N
workers		N	N
whose		N	N
companies		N	N
have		N	N
been		N	N
hit		N	N
by		N	N
the		N	N
economic		N	C
crisis		N	C
and		N	N
who		N	N
have		N	N
been		N	N
affected		N	C
by		N	N
their		N	N
companies		N	N
'		N	N
relocation		N	C

Secondly		N	N
,		N	N
Europe		N	N
must		N	N
involve		N	C
China	0.2	C	N
in		N	N
discussions		N	C
on		N	N
their		N	N
respective		N	C
African		N	N
policies		N	C

but		N	N
such		N	N
cooperation		N	C
obviously		N	C
can		N	N
not		N	N
occur		N	C
over		N	N
the		N	N
heads		N	N

believe		N	N

take		N	N

that		N	N

we		N	N

bring		N	N

I		N	N
made		N	N
that		N	N
point		N	N

However		N	N
,		N	N
we		N	N
shall		N	N
see		N	N
that		N	N
,		N	N
subject		N	N
to		N	N
a		N	N
few		N	N
clarifications	0.23214285714285698	C	C
,		N	N
in		N	N
principle		N	N
my		N	N
final		N	N
proposal		N	C

that		N	N
,		N	N
if		N	N
there		N	N
are		N	N
no		N	N

all		N	N
these		N	N

However		N	N
,		N	N
I		N	N
am		N	N
pleased		N	N
that		N	N
despite		N	C
these		N	N
challenges		N	C
we		N	N
managed		N	N
to		N	N
reach		N	N
a		N	N
compromise		N	C
that		N	N
confirms		N	C
the		N	N
basic		N	N
principles		N	C
of		N	N
the		N	N
Commission		N	C
's		N	N
proposal		N	C
,		N	N
such		N	N
as		N	N
the		N	N
extension		N	C
of		N	N
the		N	N
scope		N	C
to		N	N
energy-related		N	C
products		N	N
,		N	N
but		N	N
also		N	N
brings		N	N
more		N	N
clarifications	0.279411764705882	C	C
and		N	N
more		N	N
emphasis		N	C
on		N	N
all		N	N
relevant		N	C
environmental		N	C
parameters		N	C
.		N	N

The		N	N
proposal		N	C
contains		N	N
a		N	N
set		N	N
of		N	N
very		N	N
important		N	N
principles		N	C
and		N	N
clarifications	0.294117647058823	C	C
of		N	N
rules		N	N
that		N	N
border		N	N
guards		N	N
must		N	N
apply		N	N
when		N	N
controlling		N	C
sea		N	N

,		N	N
for		N	N
example		N	N
,		N	N
the		N	N
principle		N	C

the		N	N
obligation		N	C

unaccompanied		N	C
minors		N	N
with		N	N
special		N	N
care		N	N
.		N	N

We		N	N
should		N	N
therefore		N	N
be		N	N
proud		N	N
that		N	N
we		N	N
finally		N	N
gave		N	N
consent		N	C
to		N	N
the		N	N
agreement		N	N
that		N	N
is		N	N
so		N	N
important		N	N
for		N	N
efforts		N	N
to		N	N
track		N	N
terrorist		N	C
activities		N	N
,		N	N
especially		N	C
since		N	N
the		N	N
new		N	N

significant		N	C
improvements		N	C

and		N	N
clarifications	0.3125	C	C

have		N	N
been		N	N
largely		N	N
taken		N	N
into		N	N
account		N	N

appreciate		N	C
the		N	N
clarifications	0.4	C	C
given		N	N
by		N	N

would		N	N

to		N	N

did		N	N

not		N	N

because		N	N
I		N	N
feel		N	N
that		N	N
the		N	N
overall		N	C
content		N	C
of		N	N
the		N	N

Madam		N	N

I		N	N
gave		N	N
you		N	N
a		N	N
note		N	N

the		N	N
money		N	N

In		N	N

the		N	N
need		N	N
to		N	N
provide		N	N

with		N	N
the		N	N
necessary		N	N
resources		N	C
to		N	N
carry		N	N
out		N	N
its		N	N

was		N	N
noted		N	N

the		N	N

increase		N	N
its		N	N
operational		N	C
budget		N	C
for		N	N
2007		N	N

This		N	N
suggests		N	N
that		N	N
citizens		N	C
are		N	N
beginning		N	N
to		N	N
have		N	N
a		N	N
better		N	N
knowledge		N	N
both		N	N
of		N	N

mandate	0.44642857142857106	C	C

commensurately		N	C

Apart		N	N
from		N	N
the		N	N
general		N	N
impairment		N	C
of		N	N
human		N	N
health		N	N
,		N	N
approximately		N	C
35		N	N

On		N	N
11		N	N
May		N	N
Mr		N	N
Gusinsky		N	N
's		N	N
places		N	N
of		N	N
work		N	N

Kalashnikov		N	C
rifles		N	N
.		N	N

For		N	N
these		N	N
reasons		N	N
,		N	N
I		N	N
think		N	N
that		N	N
this		N	N
initiative		N	C
is		N	N
a		N	N
further		N	N
step		N	N
towards		N	N
the		N	N
realisation	0.294117647058823	C	C
of		N	N
the		N	N
European		N	N
Research		N	N
Area		N	N
.		N	N

Today		N	N
's		N	N
amendment		N	C
to		N	N
the		N	N
directive		N	C
as		N	N
regards		N	N
vaccination		N	C
against		N	N
bluetongue		N	C
is		N	N
a		N	N
practical		N	N
realisation	0.375	C	C
of		N	N
this		N	N
very		N	N
principle		N	N
.		N	N

Too		N	N
often		N	N
,		N	N
what		N	N
we		N	N
see		N	N
is		N	N
a		N	N
realisation	0.4	C	C
of		N	N
the		N	N
urgency		N	C
of		N	N
the		N	N
situation		N	N
and		N	N
a		N	N
juxtaposition		N	C
of		N	N
national		N	N
solutions		N	N
that		N	N
are		N	N
then		N	N
dressed		N	C
up		N	N
as		N	N
a		N	N
European		N	N
solution		N	N
.		N	N

I		N	N
therefore		N	N
believe		N	N
that		N	N
we		N	N
need		N	N
to		N	N
have		N	N
the		N	N
courage		N	C
to		N	N
tear		N	N
down		N	N
the		N	N
walls		N	N
between		N	N
private		N	N
enterprise		N	C
and		N	N
business		N	N
and		N	N
the		N	N
state		N	N
,		N	N
and		N	N
allow		N	N
entrepreneurs	0.294117647058823	C	C
to		N	N
provide		N	N
aid		N	N
in		N	N
a		N	N
way		N	N
that		N	N
is		N	N
different		N	N
from		N	N
the		N	N
way		N	N
we		N	N
have		N	N
provided		N	N
it		N	N
in		N	N
the		N	N
past		N	N
.		N	N

That		N	N
proposal		N	C
for		N	N
compromise		N	C
is		N	N
founded		N	N
on		N	N
some		N	N
of		N	N
the		N	N
resistance		N	C
from		N	N
the		N	N
Council		N	N
of		N	N
Ministers	0.294117647058823	C	N
,		N	N
and		N	N
it		N	N
disappoints		N	C
me		N	N
that		N	N
the		N	N
Council		N	N
Presidency		N	C
is		N	N
not		N	N
represented		N	C
here		N	N
tonight		N	N
.		N	N

I		N	N
hope		N	N
that		N	N
the		N	N
Ministers	0.323529411764706	C	N
adopt		N	C
this		N	N
Pact		N	C
today		N	N
and		N	N
that		N	N
it		N	N
contains		N	N
reference		N	C
to		N	N
this		N	N
common		N	N
responsibility		N	C
.		N	N

These		N	N
and		N	N
other		N	N
matters		N	N
were		N	N
on		N	N
the		N	N
agenda		N	C
at		N	N

Mr		N	N

I		N	N

In		N	N

the		N	N

And		N	N
now		N	N
I		N	N
would		N	N

to		N	N
request		N	C
again		N	N
that		N	N
I		N	N
finally		N	N
be		N	N

Last		N	N
week		N	N
,		N	N
at		N	N
a		N	N
meeting		N	N
of		N	N
experts		N	C
to		N	N
talk		N	N
about		N	N
this		N	N
new		N	N
legislation		N	C
,		N	N
we		N	N
were		N	N
reminded		N	C
that		N	N
2010		N	N
marks		N	N

50th		N	N
anniversary		N	C

Anybody		N	N
my		N	N
age		N	N
will		N	N
certainly		N	N
remember		N	N
what		N	N
thalidomide	0.7352941176470591	C	C
meant		N	N
:		N	N
the		N	N

I		N	N
therefore		N	N
call		N	N
on		N	N
the		N	N
Commission		N	C
and		N	N
the		N	N
Member		N	N
States		N	N
to		N	N
supply		N	C

The		N	N

I		N	N
think		N	N
it		N	N
is		N	N
very		N	N
important		N	N
to		N	N
add		N	N
that		N	N
more		N	N
should		N	N
be		N	N
spent		N	N
on		N	N
the		N	N
professionalism		N	C
of		N	N

to		N	N
all		N	N

because		N	N
the		N	N

Since		N	N

this		N	N
point		N	N
in		N	N

recently		N	N

may		N	N
I		N	N
begin		N	N
by		N	N
drawing		N	N
attention		N	N
once		N	N
again		N	N
to		N	N
my		N	N
declaration		N	C

The		N	N
reason		N	N
I		N	N
was		N	N
slightly		N	N
late		N	N
was		N	N
that		N	N
I		N	N
was		N	N
at		N	N
the		N	N

receiving		N	C
the		N	N
Emir	0.675	C	C

there		N	N
was		N	N
a		N	N
slight		N	C
delay		N	C
on		N	N
the		N	N
