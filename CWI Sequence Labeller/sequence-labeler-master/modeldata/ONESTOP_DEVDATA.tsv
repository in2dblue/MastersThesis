way	N

stimulating	N

One	N
of	N
the	N
main	N
themes	N

said	N
Murray	N
,	N
was	N
incredibly	C
rapid	C
change	N
in	N
the	N
leading	C
causes	N
of	N
death	N
and	N
the	N
pace	C
of	N
that	N
change	N
is	N
a	N
lot	N
faster	N
than	N
we	N
expected	C
it	N
to	N
be.Reduced	N
fertility	N
and	N
longer	N
life	N
expectancies	N
have	N
meant	N
a	N
rise	N
in	N
the	N
mean	N
age	N
of	N
the	N
worlds	N
population	N
in	N
a	N
decade	C
,	N
from	N
26	N
years	N
old	N
to	N
almost	N
30	N
.	N

It	N
has	N
been	N
dramatic	C
in	N
Latin	N
America	N
,	N
for	N
instance	C
,	N
where	N
countries	N
like	N
Brazil	N
and	N
Paraguay	N
had	N
life	N
expectancy	N
of	N
below	N
30	N
in	N
1970	N
and	N
almost	N
64	N
in	N
2010	N
.	N

That	N
is	N
a	N
35-year	N
increase	N
in	N
the	N
mean	N
age	N
of	N
death	N
over	N
four	N
decades	N
.	N

In	N
a	N
place	N
like	N
Brazil	N
,	N
the	N
speed	N
of	N
change	N
is	N
so	N
fast	N
that	N
most	N
institutions	N
are	N
ill-equipped	N
to	N
deal	C
with	N
it	N
,	N
Murray	N
said.The	N
second	N
theme	C
,	N
entwined	N
with	N
it	N
,	N
is	N
the	N
shift	C
outside	N
Africa	N
from	N
communicable	N
diseases	N
and	N
the	N
common	N
causes	N
of	N
mother	N
and	N

deaths	N
to	N
what	N
are	N
sometimes	N
termed	N
lifestyle	C
diseases	N

such	C
as	N
heart	N
disease	N
,	N
stroke	C
,	N
diabetes	N
and	N
cancer	N
some	N
of	N
which	N
have	N
significant	C
genetic	C
triggers	N

That	N
shift	C
has	N
been	N
particularly	N
marked	N
in	N
Latin	N
America	N
,	N
the	N
Middle	C
East	N
and	N
south-east	N
and	N
even	N
south	N
Asia	N
,	N
he	N
said.The	N
third	N
big	N
finding	N
was	N
,	N
Murray	N

a	N
surprise	N
to	N
us	N

That	N
was	N
the	N
sheer	C
extent	C
of	N
disability	C

the	N
toll	C
it	N
took	N
on	N
people	N
who	N
were	N
living	C
longer	N
but	N
not	N
healthier	N
lives	N
.	N

The	N
main	N
causes	N
of	N
disability	C
are	N
different	N
from	N
the	N
ones	N
that	N
kill	N
you	N
,	N
he	N
said	N

They	N
were	N
mental	C

problems	N

The	N
rates	N

these	N

But	N
there	N
are	N
a	N

when	N

have	N

that	N
the	N

we	N
are	N

call	N
an	N
organic	C

that	N
reach	N

the	N

the	N

to	N
press	N
a	N

When	N
they	N
performed	N
the	N
task	C
correctly	N
,	N
they	N
got	N
a	N

.	N

To	N
test	N
the	N
animals	N
ability	N
to	N
share	N
brain	N
information	N
,	N
they	N
put	N
the	N
rats	N
in	N
two	N

Only	N
one	N

had	N
a	N

an	N

If	N
the	N

the	N

was	N

the	N

the	N

The	N
main	N
reason	N
we	N
are	N

the	N

is	N
that	N
we	N
are	N
amazingly	N
good	N
at	N

coordinating	N

Without	N
that	N
,	N
although	N
we	N
are	N
very	N
smart	N

we	N
would	N
not	N
dominate	C
the	N
planet.I	N
dont	N

theres	N
any	N
risk	C
of	N
supersmart	N

Theres	N
a	N
big	N
difference	N
between	N

Im	N
not	N
worried	N
about	N
an	N

little	N
is	N

about	N
how	N

how	N
they	N
might	N
be	N

that	N

And	N
much	N
of	N
what	N
is	N
in	N
our	N
minds	N
is	N
what	N
Sandberg	N
calls	N
a	N
draft	C
of	N
what	N
we	N
might	N
do	N

Often	N

we	N
dont	N

those	N

that	N
would	N

for	N
the	N

There	N
was	N
an	N

intake	N

believed	N
to	N

from	N
a	N
halberd	N

a	N
fearsome	N
medieval	C
battle	N

with	N

which	N
was	N
swung	N
at	N
Richard	N
at	N
very	N
close	N

The	N
blade	C
probably	N
penetrated	N
several	N
centimetres	N

his	N
brain	N
and	N
,	N
said	N
the	N
human	N
bones	N

Jo	N
Appleby	N
,	N
he	N
would	N
have	N
been	N
unconscious	C
at	N
once	N
and	N
dead	N
almost	N
as	N
soon.The	N
injury	C
appears	N
to	N
confirm	N
contemporary	C
accounts	N
that	N
he	N
died	N
in	N
close	N
combat	C
in	N
the	N
thick	N
of	N
the	N
battle	N
and	N
unhorsed	N
as	N

would	N
also	N
have	N
proved	N
fatal	C

But	N
many	N
of	N
the	N
other	N

were	N
after	N

a	N

on	N

as	N
the	N

was	N
brought	N
back	N
to	N
Leicester	N

as	N
he	N
was	N
stripped	N

mutilated.One	N
terrible	N
injury	C
,	N
a	N
stab	C
through	N
the	N
right	N
buttock	N
and	N
into	N
his	N
pelvis	N
,	N
was	N
certainly	N
after	N
death	N
and	N
could	N
not	N
have	N
happened	N
when	N
his	N
lower	C
body	N
was	N
protected	N
by	N

It	N
suggests	N
the	N
story	N
that	N
his	N
naked	C
corpse	C
was	N
brought	N

over	N

who	N

raised	N
his	N

was	N

Baumgartner	N
later	N
told	N

:	N
When	N
I	N
was	N
standing	N
there	N
on	N

you	N
become	N

He	N
admitted	N
all	N
he	N
could	N
think	N
about	N
was	N
getting	N
back	N
alive	N
,	N
but	N
added	N
:	N
Sometimes	N
you	N
have	N
to	N
go	N
up	N
really	N
high	N
to	N
see	N
how	N
small	N
you	N
are.After	N
two	N
aborted	N
attempts	N
the	N
week	N
before	N
,	N
the	N
mission	C
was	N
given	N
the	N
go-ahead	N
on	N
Sunday	N
morning	N
with	N
the	N
cooperation	C
of	N
the	N
weather	N
.	N

Baumgartner	N
was	N
carried	N
up	N
into	N
crystal	C
clear	N
skies	N
by	N
a	N
gigantic	N
balloon	N
,	N
which	N
measured	N
30	N
million	N
square	N
cubic	N
feet	N
and	N
whose	N
skin	N
was	N
one-tenth	N
the	N
thickness	N
of	N
a	N
sandwich	N
bag	N
.	N

At	N
the	N
bottom	N
of	N
the	N
balloon	N
was	N
a	N
capsule	N
,	N
in	N
which	N
Baumgartner	N
sat	N
in	N
his	N
suit.As	N
he	N
reached	N
the	N
desired	N
height	N
,	N
Baumgartner	N
went	N
through	N
a	N
checklist	N
of	N
40	N
items	N
with	N
his	N
mentor	N
Joe	N
Kittinger	N
,	N
the	N
previous	N
holder	N
of	N
the	N
highest	N
altitude	N
manned	N
balloon	N
flight.There	N
was	N
some	N
concern	C
that	N
a	N
heater	N
for	N
his	N
visor	N
was	N
not	N
working	N
,	N
causing	N
his	N
visor	N
to	N
fog	N
.	N

This	N
is	N
very	N
serious	N
,	N
Joe	N
,	N
he	N
told	N
Kitttinger	N
.	N

Sometimes	N
its	N
getting	N
foggy	N
when	N
I	N
exhale	N
.	N

..	N
.	N

I	N
do	N
not	N
feel	N
heat	N
.	N

But	N
they	N
decided	N
to	N
go	N
ahead	N
,	N
watched	N
by	N
a	N
record	N
8	N
million	N
people	N
as	N
the	N
jump	N
was	N
streamed	N
live	N
on	N
YouTube.The	N
two-and-a-half-hour	N
journey	N
upwards	C
,	N
during	N
which	N
the	N
curvature	N
of	N
the	N
Earth	N
became	N
visible	C
and	N
the	N
skies	N
gradually	C
turned	N
black	N
,	N
was	N
matched	N
with	N
a	N
rather	N
more	N
rapid	C
descent.Three	N
cameras	N
attached	N
to	N
Baumgartners	N
suit	N
recorded	N
his	N
free-fall	N
of	N
just	N
over	N
four	N
minutes	N
which	N
failed	N
to	N
break	N
the	N
existing	C
free-fall	N
record	N
for	N
duration	C
and	N
then	N
the	N
parachute	C
opening.The	N
success	N
of	N
the	N
mission	C
,	N
and	N
of	N
the	N
suit	N
,	N
raises	N
the	N
prospect	C
that	N
astronauts	N
might	N
be	N
able	C
to	N
survive	C
a	N
high	N
altitude	N
disaster	C
of	N
the	N
type	N
that	N
struck	N
the	N
space	N
shuttle	C
Columbia	N
in	N
2003	N
by	N
actually	N
bailing	N
out	N
of	N
their	N
craft	C
.	N

Baumgartners	N
top	N
medical	C
man	N
in	N
the	N
stunt	N
was	N
Dr	N
Jonathan	N
Clark	N
,	N
whose	N
wife	N
Laurel	N
Clark	N
died	N
in	N
the	N
Columbia	N
accident	N
.	N

Clark	N
is	N
now	N
dedicated	C
to	N
improving	N
astronauts	N
chances	N
of	N
survival	C
in	N
a	N
high-altitude	N
disaster.Baumgartner	N
has	N
made	N
a	N
name	N
for	N
himself	N
with	N
acts	N
of	N
daring	N
.	N

The	N
former	N
paratrooper	N
has	N
parachuted	N
off	N
buildings	N
and	N
mountains	N
and	N
once	N
into	N
a	N
600	N
foot	N
deep	N
cave	N
.	N

He	N
had	N
already	N
done	N
two	N
practice	N
free-falls	N
in	N
preparation	N
for	N
this	N
attempt	N
one	N
from	N
71,000	N
feet	N
in	N
March	C
and	N
a	N
second	N
from	N
97,000	N
feet	N
in	N
July	N
2012	N
.	N

But	N
no	N
feat	C
can	N
possibly	N
have	N
matched	N
his	N
jump	N
above	N
the	N
town	N
of	N
Roswell	N
,	N
a	N
suitably	C
chosen	N
place	N
famed	N
for	N
its	N
connections	N
to	N

was	N
chasing	N
five	N
different	N
records	N

the	N

the	N

There	N
is	N
a	N
young	N
guy	N
asking	N
me	N
for	N
advice	N
because	N
he	N
wants	N
to	N
break	N
my	N
record	N

He	N
said	N
the	N
most	N
exciting	N
moment	N
for	N
him	N
had	N
been	N
when	N
he	N
was	N
standing	N
outside	N
the	N

of	N
the	N

To	N
laughter	C

he	N
added	N
:	N
The	N
most	N
beautiful	N
moment	N
was	N
when	N
I	N
was	N
standing	N
on	N
the	N

showed	N
up	N
and	N
he	N
had	N
a	N
smile	N
on	N
his	N
face	N
like	N
a	N
little	N
kid.Baumgartner	N
said	N
that	N
he	N
had	N
come	N
to	N
feel	N
like	N
Todds	N
son	N

adding	N
:	N
He	N
was	N
so	N
happy	N
that	N
I	N
was	N
alive	N

Earlier	N

Todd	N
had	N
told	N
the	N

The	N

To	N
further	N
laughter	C
at	N
the	N
press	N

Kittinger	N
said	N

I	N
would	N
like	N
to	N
give	N
a	N
special	N
one-fingered	N
salute	N
to	N
all	N

that	N
he	N
[	N
Baumgartner	N

was	N
going	N
to	N

he	N
went	N
supersonic.This	N
will	N
be	N
the	N
last	N

Baumgartner	N

He	N
has	N
promised	N
to	N
settle	C
down	N

Valdevaqueros	N
is	N
one	N
of	N
the	N
last	N
remaining	C
unspoilt	N
beaches	N
in	N
southern	N
Spain	N

where	N
the	N

Currently	C
the	N

decades	N
it	N
has	N

a	N

from	N
the	N
concrete-lined	N
beaches	N
of	N
Torremolinos	N
and	N
Marbella	N
along	N
the	N
coast	N
,	N
yet	N
on	N
29	N
May	N
the	N
local	N
council	C
in	N
Tarifa	N
approved	N
plans	N
to	N
build	N
a	N
tourist	N
complex	C
right	N
next	N
to	N
the	N
beach	N
,	N
with	N
1,400	N
hotel	N

and	N
350	N

Environmental	N
and	N
conservation	C
groups	N
have	N
protested	N
that	N
the	N
project	N
will	N
harm	C
the	N
habitats	N
of	N

,	N
but	N
for	N
most	N
councillors	N
here	N
the	N
issue	N
is	N
simple	N
:	N
jobs	N

In	N
this	N
town	N
of	N
18,000	N
inhabitants	N
,	N
2,600	N
are	N
out	N
of	N

its	N
worst	N
economic	C
crisis	C
in	N
at	N

half	N
a	N

such	C

now	N
that	N

are	N
being	N

from	N
the	N
Socialist	C
Party	N
,	N
which	N
is	N
in	N

in	N

Galindo	N

it	N
complies	N

The	N

would	N
be	N
800	N

comfortably	C
beyond	C
the	N

in	N
the	N
1960s	N

1970s.Opponents	N
of	N
the	N
complex	C
say	N
the	N
last	N
thing	N
anyone	N
needs	C
is	N
more	N
housing	C
in	N
a	N

that	N
already	N

a	N

although	N
the	N

Socialist	C
opposition	C
in	N
Madrid	N
attacked	N
the	N
proposal	C
,	N
and	N
Galindo	N
said	N
it	N
discriminated	N
against	N
migrant	N
workers	N
who	N
flocked	N
to	N
Spain	N
during	N
the	N
boom	N
years	N
,	N
many	N
of	N
them	N
from	N
Morocco	N

whose	N
coastline	C
is	N
just	N
14km	N
away	N
and	N
can	N
be	N
seen	N
from	N
Tarifa	N

It	N
favours	N
moneyed	N

rather	N
than	N
those	N
who	N
came	N
here	N
to	N
help	N
Spain	N
get	N
ahead	N
,	N
he	N
said.Surfers	N
fear	N
that	N
new	N

in	N
Valdevaqueros	N
would	N
reduce	N
the	N
strength	C

the	N

Just	N
wait	N
until	N
they	N
see	N
what	N
a	N

Ten	N
years	N

they	N
said	N
they	N
would	N
build	N
a	N
new	N
highway	N
here	N
.	N

It	N
didnt	N
happen	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
think	N
it	N
will	N
be	N
impossible	N
to	N
build	N
new	N
hotels.At	N
the	N
southernmost	N
tip	N
of	N
Spain	N

Tarifa	N
is	N
the	N
strategic	C

between	N

Europe	N
,	N
where	N
the	N
Mediterranean	N
Sea	N
meets	N
the	N
Atlantic	N

Campaigners	N
say	N
it	N
also	N
has	N
a	N
vital	C
role	N
in	N
the	N
animal	N
world	N
as	N
a	N
crossroads	C
for	N
migrating	N
species.The	N
campaign	C
to	N
save	N
the	N

was	N
launched	N
hours	N
after	N
the	N
Tarifa	N
council	C
voted	N
for	N
the	N
project	N

The	N
campaign	C
has	N
a	N
Facebook	N

is	N
supported	N

the	N
Spanish	N
branch	N

Its	N
the	N
environmental	N
equivalent	C
of	N
putting	N
a	N
shopping	N
centre	N
right	N
in	N
the	N
middle	C
of	N
the	N
Alhambra	N

Noelia	N

who	N
uses	N
her	N
multimedia	N
expertise	N
to	N
campaign	C
against	N
the	N

She	N
also	N
noted	N
that	N
the	N
resort	N
would	N
be	N
near	N
the	N
ancient	N
Roman	N
town	N
of	N
Baelo	N

They	N
could	N
be	N
building	N
on	N
top	N
of	N
more	N
Roman	N
ruins	N
here	N
.	N

Nobody	N
knows.Also	N
joining	N
the	N
opposition	C
to	N
the	N
planned	N
resort	N
is	N
the	N
Andalusian	N
College	N
of	N
Geographers	N
,	N
which	N
,	N
in	N
a	N
preliminary	C
study	N
charted	N
on	N
its	N
website	N
,	N
concluded	N
that	N
free	N
areas	N
,	N
including	N
car	N
parks	N
if	N
not	N
actual	C
buildings	N
,	N
will	N
overlap	C
part	N
of	N
the	N
Alcornocales	N
National	N
Park	N
.	N

The	N
geographers	N
also	N
estimate	C
that	N
the	N
site	N
intrudes	N
on	N
two	N
wildlife	N
conservation	C
areas	N
.	N

One	N
of	N
the	N
areas	N
in	N
Valdevaqueros	N
is	N
home	N
to	N
two	N
species	C
of	N
bat	N
whose	N
survival	C
is	N
threatened.Money	N
is	N
once	N
again	N
being	N
put	N
before	N
urban	C
laws	N
and	N
European	N
environmental	N
directives	N

of	N
the	N
European	N
Parliament	C
who	N
is	N
Vice-President	N
of	N
the	N
Greens	N
group	N
.	N

In	N
Romevas	N
view	N
,	N
the	N
project	N
is	N
also	N
at	N
fault	C
because	N
the	N
proposed	C
site	N
has	N
too	N
little	N
water	N
in	N
a	N
town	N
that	N
already	N
suffers	N
from	N
shortages	N
in	N
the	N
summer	N
weather	N
that	N
scorches	N
the	N
southern	N
Spanish	N
region	N
of	N
Andalusa	N
.	N

Lack	C
of	N
water	N
recently	N
led	N
the	N
Andalusa	N
Supreme	N
Court	N
to	N
uphold	C
an	N
appeal	C
against	N
plans	N
to	N
build	N
a	N
complex	C
elsewhere	C
in	N
the	N
region	N
,	N
which	N
would	N
have	N
included	N
golf	N
courses	N
,	N
hotels	N
and	N
luxury	N
homes	N
.	N

Many	N
locals	N
are	N
also	N
wondering	N
why	N
a	N
resort	N
should	N
be	N
built	N
10km	N
away	N
,	N
rather	N
than	N
on	N
wasteland	N
near	N
Tarifas	N
picturesque	C
old	N
centre	N
,	N
with	N
its	N
typically	N
Andalusian	N
whitewashed	N
walls	N
and	N
winding	C
streets	N
,	N
dominated	N
by	N
a	N
10th-century	N
Moorish	N
castle	N
.	N

My	N
opinion	N
and	N
that	N
of	N
catering	C
workers	N
is	N
that	N
we	N
agree	N
with	N
the	N
complex	C
as	N
long	N
as	N
it	N
creates	N
jobs	N
in	N
the	N
town	N
,	N
which	N
is	N
what	N
is	N
needed	N
,	N
but	N
we	N
are	N
against	N
it	N
being	N
for	N
the	N
benefit	N
of	N
a	N
few	N
,	N
said	N
Cristbal	N
Lobato	N

who	N
has	N
worked	N
at	N
the	N
same	N
beachside	N
bar	N
in	N
Tarifa	N
for	N
30	N
years	N
.	N

If	N
they	N
put	N
it	N
in	N
the	N
centre	N
of	N
Tarifa	N
,	N
where	N
there	N
is	N
space	N

Anywhere	N
else	N
in	N
Europe	N
,	N
this	N
place	N
would	N
have	N
the	N

it	N
all	N
and	N
cover	N
it	N
with	N

What	N
they	N
want	N
to	N
do	N
is	N
turn	N
this	N
into	N
Benidorm	N

but	N
what	N
draws	N

Swedish	N
prisons	N
have	N
long	N
had	N
a	N
reputation	C
around	N
the	N

for	N
being	N
progressive	C

But	N
are	N
the	N
countrys	N
prisons	N
a	N
soft	N
option	N

The	N
head	N
of	N
Swedens	N
prison	N
and	N
probation	N
service	N
,	N
Nils	N
Oberg	N
,	N
announced	N
in	N
November	N
2013	N
that	N
four	N
Swedish	N
prisons	N
are	N
to	N
be	N
closed	N
due	N
to	N
an	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
ordinary	N
decline	C
in	N
prisoner	N
numbers.Although	N
there	N
has	N
been	N
no	N
fall	N
in	N
crime	N
rates	N
,	N
between	N
2011	N
and	N
2012	N
there	N
was	N
a	N
6	N
%	N
drop	N
in	N
Swedens	N
prisoner	N
population	N
,	N
now	N
a	N
little	N
over	N
4,500	N
.	N

A	N
similar	N
decrease	N
is	N
expected	C
in	N
2013	N
and	N
2014	N
.	N

Oberg	N
admitted	N
to	N
being	N
puzzled	C
by	N
the	N
unexpected	N
dip	C
,	N
but	N
expressed	N
optimism	C
that	N
the	N
reason	N
was	N
to	N
do	N
with	N
how	N
his	N
prisons	N
are	N
run	N
.	N

We	N
certainly	N
hope	N
that	N
the	N
efforts	N
we	N
invest	C
in	N
rehabilitation	N
and	N
preventing	N
relapse	N
of	N
crime	N
has	N
had	N
an	N
impact	C
,	N
he	N
said.The	N
modern	N
prison	N
service	N
in	N
Sweden	N
is	N
very	N
different	N
from	N
when	N
I	N
joined	N
as	N
a	N
young	N
prison	N
officer	N
in	N
1978	N
,	N
says	N
Kenneth	N
Gustafsson	N
,	N
governor	N
of	N
Kumla	N
Prison	N
,	N
Swedens	N
most	N
secure	C
jail	N
,	N
situated	N
130	N
miles	C
west	N
of	N
Stockholm	N
.	N

However	N
,	N
he	N
doesnt	N
think	N
the	N
system	N
has	N
gone	N
soft	N
.	N

When	N
I	N
joined	N
,	N
the	N
focus	C
was	N
very	N
much	N
on	N
humanity	C
in	N
prisons	N
.	N

Prisoners	N
were	N
treated	N
well	N
maybe	N
too	N
well	N
,	N
some	N
might	N
say	N
.	N

But	N
,	N
after	N
a	N
number	N
of	N
high-profile	C
escapes	N
in	N
2004	N
,	N
we	N
had	N
to	N
rebalance	N
and	N
place	N
more	N
emphasis	C
on	N
security.Despite	N
the	N
hardening	N
of	N
attitudes	N
toward	N
prison	N
security	N
following	C
the	N
escape	N
scandals	N
,	N
the	N
Swedes	N
still	N
managed	N
to	N

broadly	C
humane	N
approach	N
to	N

One	N

strong	N
reason	N
for	N
the	N

numbers	N
might	N
be	N
the	N
amount	N

In	N

the	N

For	N

These	N
are	N
the	N

things	N
for	N

when	N
these	N

spoke	N
to	N
a	N
former	N

who	N
now	N
runs	N
a	N
social	N
enterprise	C
called	N
X-Cons	N

Peter	N
Soderlund	N
served	N
almost	N
three	N
years	N
of	N
a	N
four-year	N
sentence	N
for	N
drug	C
and	N
weapons	N
offences	N
before	N
he	N
was	N
released	N
in	N
1998	N

He	N
was	N
helped	N
by	N
a	N
newly	C
formed	N
organization	N
run	N
by	N
former	N
prisoners	N
called	N
Kris	N
(	N
Criminals	N
Return	N
Into	N
Society	N
)	N
.The	N
big	N
difference	N
between	N
Kris	N
and	N
us	N
is	N
that	N
we	N
are	N
happy	N
to	N
allow	N
people	N
who	N
are	N
still	N
taking	N
addiction	C
medications	N
to	N
join	N
us	N
,	N
he	N
says	N
.	N

Both	N
organizations	N
work	N
with	N
the	N
same	N
goal	N
:	N
helping	N
prisoners	N
successfully	C
reintegrate	N
into	N
society	N
after	N
they	N
have	N
been	N
released	N
.	N

And	N
what	N
is	N
life	N
like	N
for	N
the	N
prisoner	N
in	N
Sweden	N
?	N
When	N
I	N
was	N
inside	N
,	N
I	N
was	N
lucky	N
.	N

In	N
Osteraker	N
Prison	N
,	N
where	N
I	N
served	N
my	N
sentence	N
,	N
the	N
governor	N
was	N
enlightened	N
.	N

We	N
were	N
treated	N
well	N
.	N

But	N
I	N
knew	N
that	N
not	N
all	N
Swedish	N
prisons	N
were	N
like	N
that	N
.	N

I	N
met	N
so	N
many	N
people	N
in	N
there	N
who	N
needed	N
help	N
after	N
I	N
received	N
help	N
from	N
Kris	N
,	N
I	N
knew	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
help	N
others	N
.	N

With	N
X-Cons	N
,	N
we	N
meet	N
them	N
at	N
the	N
gate	N
and	N
support	N
them	N
into	N
accommodation	N
and	N
offer	N
a	N
network	C
of	N
support.In	N
Sweden	N
,	N
we	N
believe	N
very	N
much	N
in	N
the	N
concept	C
of	N
rehabilitation	N
,	N
without	N
being	N
naive	C
of	N
course	N
,	N
says	N
Gustafsson	N
.	N

There	N
are	N
some	N
people	N
who	N
will	N
not	N
or	N
can	N
not	N
change	N
.	N

But	N
,	N
in	N
my	N
experience	N
,	N
the	N
majority	C
of	N
prisoners	N
want	N
to	N
change	N
,	N
and	N
we	N
must	N
do	N
what	N
we	N
can	N
to	N
help	N
to	N
facilitate	C
that	N
.	N

It	N
is	N
not	N
always	N
possible	N
to	N
achieve	N
this	N
in	N
one	N
prison	N
sentence.Also	N
,	N
it	N
is	N
not	N
just	N
prison	N
that	N
can	N
rehabilitate	N
it	N
is	N
often	N
a	N
combined	N
process	C
,	N
involving	N
probation	N
and	N
greater	N
society	N
.	N

We	N
can	N
give	N
education	N
and	N
training	N
,	N
but	N
,	N
when	N
they	N
leave	N
prison	N
,	N
these	N
people	N
need	N
housing	C
and	N
jobs	N
.	N

It	N
is	N
hard	N
to	N
tell	N
exactly	N
where	N
the	N
noise	N
is	N
coming	N
from	N
,	N
but	N
impossible	N
to	N
miss	N
it	N
from	N
anywhere	N
in	N
Damascus	N
:	N
all	N
day	N
and	N
night	N
you	N
can	N
hear	N
the	N
dull	N
thud	N
and	N
boom	N
of	N
artillery	N
,	N
rockets	N
or	N
planes	N
pounding	N
rebel	C
positions	N
the	N
sound	N
of	N
war	N
getting	N
closer	N
to	N
Syrias	N
capital	N
.	N

But	N
just	N
over	N
two	N
years	N
into	N
the	N
Syrian	N
crisis	C
the	N
longest	N
and	N
bloodiest	N
of	N
the	N
Arab	N
uprisings	N
ignoring	N
the	N
sound	N
of	N
death	N
and	N
destruction	C
nearby	N
has	N
become	N
the	N
new	N
normal	N
for	N
Damascenes.Over	N
the	N
weekend	N
,	N
men	N
could	N
be	N
seen	N
puffing	N
on	N
water	N
pipes	N
in	N
a	N
palm-shaded	N
park	N
,	N
children	N
playing	N
between	N
the	N
flowerbeds	N
and	N
couples	N
chatting	N
on	N
benches	N
as	N
the	N
unmistakable	N
thunderclap	N
of	N
high	N
explosive	C
could	N
be	N
heard	N
a	N
few	N

away	N
smoke	N
rising	N
between	N
the	N
minarets	N

But	N
you	N
never	N

exactly	N
what	N
they	N
are	N
hitting	N

That	N
usually	N
becomes	N
clear	N
later	N
from	N

posted	N
by	N
opposition	C

sinister	N
background	N

to	N

you	N

Unsurprisingly	N

this	N
research	N

In	N
2008	N
,	N
the	N
Pentagon	N
published	N
a	N
report	N
called	N
Human	N
Performance	N
which	N
examined	N
the	N
possibility	N
of	N
a	N
future	N
in	N
which	N
soldiers	N
could	N
perform	N
at	N
their	N
peak	N
with	N
only	N
a	N
couple	N
of	N
hours	N
sleep	N

Suppose	C
a	N
human	N
could	N
be	N
engineered	N
who	N
slept	N
for	N
the	N
same	N
amount	N
of	N
time	N
as	N
a	N
giraffe	N
(	N
1.9	N
hours	N
per	N
night	N
)	N
.	N

This	N
would	N
lead	N
to	N
an	N
approximately	N
twofold	N
decrease	N

the	N
casualty	C
rate	C

An	N
adversary	N
would	N
need	N
an	N
approximately	N
40	N

increase	N
in	N
the	N
troop	N
level	N
to	N
compensate	C
for	N
this	N
advantage	N
.	N

The	N
report	N
goes	N
on	N

look	N
at	N
the	N
effects	N

remove	N
