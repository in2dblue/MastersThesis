After	N
playing	N
football	N
with	N
my	N
friends	N
,	N
I	N
was	N
all	N
sweaty	N
and	N
dirty	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
decide	N
I	N
should	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N

First	N
I	N
made	N
sure	N
there	N
were	N
clean	N
towels	N
available	N
and	N
enough	N
soap	N
and	N
shampoo	N
to	N
thoroughly	C
clean	N
my	N
skin	N
and	N
hair	N
.	N

I	N
put	N
the	N
plug	N
in	N
the	N
bottom	N
of	N
the	N
bath	N
tub	N
and	N
turned	N
on	N
the	N
water	N
,	N
being	N
careful	N
to	N
adjust	C
the	N
water	N
to	N
a	N
nice	N
warm	N
,	N
but	N
no	N
too	N
hot	N
,	N
temperature	N
.	N

I	N
used	N
my	N
finger	N
to	N
determine	C
just	N
the	N
right	N
temperature	N
.	N

After	N
removing	N
my	N
clothes	N
and	N
placing	N
them	N
in	N
the	N
hamper	N
,	N
I	N
carefully	N
stepped	N
into	N
the	N
tub	N
,	N
being	N
sure	N
to	N
steady	C
myself	N
as	N
I	N
entered	N
.	N

I	N
gingerly	N
lowered	N
myself	N
into	N
the	N
nice	N
warm	N
water	N
and	N
immediately	N
began	N
to	N
relax	N
.	N

After	N
a	N
few	N
minutes	N
of	N
rest	N
and	N
relaxation	N
,	N
I	N
got	N
out	N
the	N
soap	N
and	N
thoroughly	C
washed	N
my	N
whole	N
body	N
,	N
making	N
sure	N
to	N
get	N
all	N
of	N
the	N
dirt	N
and	N
grass	N
stains	N
off	N
that	N
I	N
had	N
accumulated	N
from	N
playing	N
football	N
.	N

Next	N
I	N
washed	N
my	N
hair	N
with	N
shampoo	N
and	N
laid	N
back	N
into	N
the	N
water	N
to	N
really	N
rinse	N
it	N
out	N
well	N
.	N

I	N
carefully	N
exited	N
the	N
bath	N
tub	N
,	N
making	N
sure	N
to	N
step	N
onto	N
the	N
bath	N
mat	C
so	N
I	N
would	N
n't	N
slip	N
on	N
the	N
smooth	N
floor	N
tiles	N
,	N
and	N
got	N
a	N
towel	N
and	N
dried	N
myself	N
off	N
.	N

Now	N
my	N
bath	N
was	N
complete	N
and	N
I	N
felt	N
so	N
nice	N
and	N
clean	N
!	N
What	N
a	N
great	N
feeling	N
!	N
I	N
like	N
taking	N
a	N
bath	N
instead	N
of	N
a	N
shower	N
sometimes	N
.	N

I	N
start	N
by	N
closing	N
the	N
drain	C
at	N
the	N
bottom	N
of	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N

Some	N
tubs	N
have	N
a	N
stopper	N
and	N
some	N
have	N
a	N
thing	N
you	N
push	N
down	N
to	N
close	N
it	N
.	N

After	N
it	N
's	N
closed	N
I	N
like	N
to	N
run	N
both	N
hot	N
and	N
cold	N
water	N
to	N
make	N
warm	N
water	N
and	N
then	N
I	N
let	N
the	N
tub	N
fill	N
up	N
to	N
about	N
a	N
hand	N
's	N
height	N
from	N
the	N
top	N
of	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N

While	N
the	N
water	N
is	N
running	N
,	N
I	N
squirt	N
in	N
bubbles	N
and	N
make	N
sure	N
I	N
have	N
a	N
clean	N
washcloth	N
and	N
towel	N
.	N

After	N
I	N
carefully	N
climb	N
into	N
the	N
tub	N
,	N
I	N
make	N
sure	N
I	N
wash	N
my	N
whole	N
body	N
with	N
the	N
soap	N
and	N
washcloth	N
,	N
even	N
behind	N
my	N
ears	N
and	N
between	N
my	N
toes	N
.	N

Then	N
I	N
can	N
either	N
soak	C
and	N
relax	N
in	N
the	N
tub	N
or	N
I	N
can	N
play	N
with	N
toys	N
.	N

Fun	N
toys	N
for	N
the	N
bathtub	N
are	N
boats	N
and	N
plastic	N
water	N
animals	N
like	N
whales	N
and	N
ducks	N
.	N

Once	N
the	N
water	N
starts	N
to	N
turn	N
a	N
little	N
cold	N
,	N
it	N
's	N
time	N
to	N
get	N
out	N
so	N
I	N
open	N
the	N
drain	C
again	N
and	N
let	N
the	N
water	N
empty	N
out	N
.	N

While	N
it	N
's	N
draining	N
I	N
carefully	N
stand	N
up	N
and	N
reach	N
for	N
my	N
towel	N
to	N
dry	N
off	N
.	N

I	N
always	N
be	N
sure	N
the	N
tub	N
is	N
clean	N
when	N
I	N
'm	N
finished	N
,	N
with	N
toys	N
and	N
the	N
dirty	N
washcloth	N
put	N
where	N
they	N
belong	C
.	N

Last	N
night	N
,	N
I	N
took	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N

I	N
take	N
baths	N
when	N
I	N
have	N
time	N
to	N
relax	N
and	N
soak	C
in	N
bubbles	N
.	N

Baths	N
are	N
important	N
for	N
good	N
hygiene	C
and	N
self	C
esteem	N
.	N

I	N
always	N
feel	N
so	N
much	N
better	N
when	N
I	N
am	N
clean	N
and	N
smell	N
like	N
my	N
favorite	N
soap	N
.	N

I	N
like	N
to	N
fill	N
the	N
tub	N
up	N
as	N
full	N
as	N
I	N
can	N
and	N
pick	N
a	N
shower	N
gel	N
or	N
bubble	C
bath	N
to	N
make	N
lots	N
and	N
lots	N
of	N
bubbles	N
.	N

I	N
just	N
soak	C
in	N
the	N
bubbles	N
and	N
enjoy	N
the	N
time	N
to	N
myself	N
.	N

Then	N
I	N
wash	N
my	N
hair	N
with	N
shampoo	N
and	N
conditioner	N
.	N

Next	N
,	N
I	N
make	N
sure	N
to	N
scrub	N
everywhere	N
from	N
between	N
my	N
toes	N
to	N
behind	N
my	N
ears	N
with	N
soap	N
.	N

After	N
that	N
,	N
I	N
am	N
ready	N
to	N
dry	N
off	N
and	N
get	N
into	N
some	N
clean	N
clothes	N
.	N

If	N
I	N
do	N
n't	N
have	N
time	N
for	N
a	N
bath	N
,	N
I	N
just	N
take	N
a	N
shower	N
.	N

Showers	N
are	N
much	N
faster	N
!	N
No	N
matter	N
what	N
I	N
choose	N
,	N
I	N
make	N
sure	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
or	N
a	N
shower	N
every	N
day	N
.	N

I	N
went	N
into	N
my	N
bathroom	N
and	N
started	N
to	N
run	N
the	N
bath	N
,	N
letting	N
the	N
water	N
get	N
warm	N
enough	N
.	N

Once	N
warm	N
,	N
I	N
plugged	N
up	N
the	N
drain	C
and	N
the	N
bath	N
began	N
to	N
fill	N
.	N

I	N
dripped	N
some	N
bubble	C
bath	N
into	N
the	N
water	N
to	N
get	N
it	N
nice	N
and	N
bubbly	N
.	N

Suds	N
filled	N
the	N
tub	N
along	N
with	N
warm	N
water	N
,	N
creating	N
a	N
heavenly	C
scent	C
.	N

Once	N
the	N
tub	N
was	N
filled	N
,	N
I	N
disrobed	N
and	N
got	N
in	N
.	N

I	N
sat	N
for	N
a	N
moment	N
,	N
relaxing	N
,	N
allowing	N
the	N
warm	N
water	N
to	N
sooth	N
my	N
skin	N
.	N

After	N
a	N
few	N
moments	N
,	N
I	N
grabbed	N
a	N
bar	N
of	N
soap	N
and	N
lathered	N
my	N
body	N
.	N

I	N
washed	N
myself	N
carefully	N
because	N
I	N
did	N
not	N
want	N
to	N
spill	N
water	N
onto	N
the	N
floor	N
.	N

I	N
washed	N
my	N
hair	N
and	N
dunked	N
my	N
head	N
under	N
water	N
to	N
clear	N
the	N
shampoo	N
and	N
conditioner	N
.	N

After	N
awhile	N
the	N
water	N
began	N
to	N
cool	N
.	N

Since	N
I	N
was	N
done	N
washing	N
,	N
I	N
unplugged	N
the	N
drain	C
and	N
let	N
the	N
water	N
drain	C
out	N
.	N

I	N
grabbed	N
a	N
towel	N
and	N
dried	N
off	N
.	N

I	N
then	N
left	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N

Each	N
night	N
after	N
we	N
finish	N
eating	N
our	N
dinner	N
,	N
I	N
go	N
upstairs	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N

The	N
first	N
thing	N
that	N
I	N
do	N
is	N
get	N
myself	N
a	N
clean	N
towel	N
and	N
wash	N
cloth	C
.	N

I	N
put	N
these	N
items	N
on	N
the	N
side	N
of	N
the	N
bath	N
tub	N
in	N
my	N
bathroom	N
.	N

I	N
then	N
put	N
the	N
stopper	N
in	N
the	N
drain	C
of	N
the	N
bathtub	N
and	N
turn	N
on	N
the	N
water	N
faucet	N
.	N

I	N
wait	N
for	N
the	N
water	N
to	N
warm	N
up	N
and	N
check	N
it	N
with	N
my	N
hand	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
it	N
is	N
warm	N
and	N
not	N
too	N
hot	N
.	N

Once	N
the	N
bath	N
tub	N
is	N
half	N
way	N
full	N
,	N
I	N
turn	N
off	N
the	N
water	N
.	N

Then	N
I	N
take	N
off	N
my	N
clothes	N
and	N
climb	N
into	N
the	N
bath	N
tub	N
.	N

I	N
get	N
my	N
wash	N
cloth	C
and	N
put	N
it	N
under	N
the	N
water	N
.	N

I	N
then	N
get	N
the	N
soap	N
and	N
rub	C
it	N
on	N
my	N
wet	N
wash	N
cloth	C
to	N
make	N
suds	N
.	N

The	N
next	N
thing	N
to	N
do	N
is	N
take	N
the	N
wash	N
cloth	C
and	N
wash	N
my	N
entire	C
body	N
,	N
starting	N
with	N
my	N
face	N
and	N
ending	N
with	N
my	N
toes	N
.	N

After	N
I	N
have	N
washed	N
everything	N
,	N
I	N
rinse	N
the	N
soap	N
from	N
my	N
body	N
with	N
the	N
water	N
in	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N

Finally	N
,	N
I	N
get	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
tub	N
,	N
take	N
the	N
stopper	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
drain	C
to	N
let	N
the	N
water	N
out	N
,	N
and	N
use	N
my	N
towel	N
to	N
dry	N
off	N
.	N

I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
yesterday	N
afternoon	N
after	N
working	N
out	N
.	N

Once	N
I	N
got	N
back	N
home	N
,	N
I	N
walked	N
to	N
my	N
bathroom	N
and	N
first	N
quickly	N
scrubbed	N
the	N
bathroom	N
tub	N
by	N
turning	N
on	N
the	N
water	N
and	N
rinsing	N
it	N
clean	N
with	N
a	N
rag	N
.	N

.	N

After	N
I	N
finished	N
,	N
I	N
plugged	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
began	N
filling	N
it	N
with	N
warm	N
water	N
set	N
at	N
about	N
98	N
degrees	N
.	N

While	N
waiting	N
for	N
the	N
tub	N
to	N
fill	N
up	N
,	N
I	N
undressed	C
and	N
closed	N
the	N
bathroom	N
door	N
.	N

About	N
5	N
minutes	N
later	N
,	N
the	N
tub	N
was	N
filled	N
up	N
and	N
I	N
shut	N
off	N
the	N
water	N
.	N

I	N
briefly	N
tested	N
the	N
water	N
with	N
my	N
elbow	N
and	N
then	N
stepped	N
into	N
the	N
tub	N
to	N
lay	N
down	N
.	N

For	N
about	N
25	N
minutes	N
,	N
I	N
lay	N
in	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
relaxed	N
by	N
closing	N
my	N
eyes	N
.	N

I	N
had	N
also	N
took	N
the	N
time	N
to	N
read	N
pages	N
of	N
a	N
book	N
I	N
had	N
brought	N
with	N
me	N
.	N

Once	N
my	N
body	N
was	N
totally	N
relaxed	N
,	N
I	N
took	N
a	N
quick	N
shower	N
to	N
rinse	N
myself	N
off	N
and	N
then	N
drained	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N

Next	N
,	N
I	N
dried	N
myself	N
off	N
with	N
a	N
towel	N
and	N
put	N
my	N
clothes	N
back	N
on	N
.	N

It	N
was	N
a	N
great	N
relaxing	N
experience	N
after	N
exercising	N
in	N
the	N
cold	N
winter	N
day	N
.	N

Last	N
night	N
,	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N

I	N
chose	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
because	N
I	N
find	N
it	N
to	N
be	N
more	N
relaxing	N
at	N
bed	N
time	N
than	N
taking	N
a	N
shower	N
.	N

I	N
put	N
my	N
hair	N
up	N
in	N
a	N
bun	C
so	N
it	N
would	N
stay	N
dry	N
.	N

I	N
stuck	C
the	N
stopper	N
in	N
the	N
drain	C
so	N
the	N
water	N
would	N
stay	N
in	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N

I	N
turned	N
on	N
the	N
faucets	N
and	N
felt	N
the	N
water	N
until	N
I	N
had	N
the	N
right	N
temperature	N
.	N

I	N
made	N
the	N
bath	N
a	N
little	N
hot	N
so	N
it	N
would	N
n't	N
get	N
cold	N
too	N
fast	N
.	N

While	N
the	N
water	N
was	N
running	N
,	N
I	N
took	N
the	N
bottle	N
of	N
bubble	C
bath	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
closet	N
.	N

I	N
opened	N
it	N
up	N
and	N
squirted	N
a	N
little	N
bit	N
of	N
bubble	C
bath	N
under	N
the	N
running	N
water	N
so	N
the	N
water	N
would	N
get	N
nice	N
and	N
foamy	N
.	N

I	N
then	N
took	N
out	N
a	N
fresh	N
towel	N
and	N
a	N
loofah	N
sponge	N
.	N

I	N
stepped	N
over	N
the	N
edge	N
of	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
sunk	N
into	N
the	N
water	N
slowly	N
.	N

The	N
hot	N
water	N
felt	N
so	N
good	N
on	N
my	N
skin	N
and	N
I	N
instantly	C
felt	N
relaxed	N
.	N

I	N
grabbed	N
a	N
bar	N
of	N
soap	N
and	N
rubbed	N
some	N
on	N
my	N
loofah	N
before	N
scrubbing	N
down	N
.	N

After	N
a	N
good	N
scrub	N
,	N
I	N
soaked	C
in	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
relaxed	N
for	N
a	N
good	N
twenty	N
minutes	N
.	N

Then	N
I	N
pulled	N
the	N
stopper	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
sat	N
there	N
while	N
the	N
water	N
went	N
down	N
.	N

After	N
the	N
water	N
was	N
almost	N
all	N
gone	N
,	N
I	N
very	N
carefully	N
stood	N
up	N
and	N
blotted	N
myself	N
dry	N
with	N
a	N
towel	N
.	N

Finally	N
,	N
I	N
put	N
on	N
my	N
bathrobe	N
and	N
headed	N
to	N
my	N
room	N
.	N

Last	N
night	N
I	N
took	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N

First	N
,	N
I	N
plugged	N
the	N
bath	N
drain	C
.	N

Then	N
,	N
I	N
filled	N
the	N
bathtub	N
with	N
warm	N
water	N
.	N

I	N
poured	N
some	N
bubble	C
bath	N
mixture	C
into	N
the	N
tub	N
while	N
the	N
bath	N
was	N
filling	N
so	N
that	N
my	N
bath	N
would	N
have	N
bubbles	N
.	N

.	N

I	N
then	N
got	N
undressed	C
.	N

When	N
the	N
bath	N
was	N
full	N
,	N
I	N
turned	N
off	N
the	N
water	N
and	N
climbed	N
into	N
the	N
warm	N
tub	N
.	N

I	N
felt	N
very	N
relaxed	N
as	N
I	N
lay	N
in	N
the	N
warm	N
bubble	C
bath	N
.	N

I	N
shut	N
my	N
eyes	N
for	N
a	N
moment	N
to	N
enjoy	N
the	N
sensation	C
.	N

I	N
then	N
washed	N
my	N
hair	N
,	N
lathering	N
the	N
shampoo	N
into	N
my	N
hair	N
,	N
then	N
rinsing	N
it	N
off	N
in	N
the	N
bath	N
water	N
.	N

Next	N
,	N
I	N
washed	N
my	N
whole	N
body	N
with	N
a	N
bar	N
of	N
soap	N
.	N

When	N
I	N
was	N
completely	N
clean	N
,	N
I	N
stepped	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
bath	N
and	N
wrapped	N
a	N
towel	N
around	N
myself	N
.	N

I	N
wrapped	N
a	N
second	N
towel	N
around	N
my	N
hair	N
to	N
keep	N
it	N
from	N
dripping	N
everywhere	N
.	N

I	N
then	N
unplugged	N
the	N
bath	N
drain	C
to	N
let	N
the	N
water	N
drain	C
out	N
of	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N

Taking	N
a	N
bath	N
can	N
be	N
a	N
very	N
relaxing	N
thing	N
to	N
do	N
especially	N
right	N
before	N
bed	N
.	N

You	N
can	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
to	N
clean	N
yourself	N
or	N
just	N
to	N
soak	C
and	N
relax	N
but	N
both	N
can	N
be	N
an	N
enjoyable	N
experience	N
.	N

Get	N
your	N
needed	N
items	N
together	N
first	N
.	N

This	N
will	N
include	N
a	N
towel	N
for	N
drying	N
off	N
and	N
any	N
personal	N
body	N
supplies	N
such	C
as	N
soaps	N
.	N

You	N
may	N
want	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
quick	N
shower	N
off	N
first	N
so	N
that	N
your	N
bath	N
water	N
stays	N
clean	N
as	N
you	N
soak	C
.	N

You	N
will	N
want	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
the	N
tub	N
is	N
clean	N
first	N
and	N
you	N
might	N
want	N
to	N
wipe	C
the	N
bottom	N
and	N
sides	N
off	N
.	N

When	N
you	N
are	N
ready	N
for	N
your	N
bath	N
you	N
want	N
to	N
first	N
fill	N
your	N
tub	N
with	N
water	N
using	N
a	N
temperature	N
you	N
find	N
pleasant	N
but	N
make	N
sure	N
you	N
have	N
put	N
the	N
plug	N
in	N
so	N
your	N
water	N
does	N
not	N
drain	C
away	N
.	N

Its	N
nice	N
to	N
use	N
bubble	C
bath	N
,	N
or	N
bath	N
salts	N
,	N
or	N
even	N
bath	N
oils	N
.	N

When	N
taking	N
a	N
bath	N
setting	C
a	N
relaxing	N
atmosphere	N
is	N
also	N
nice	N
.	N

You	N
can	N
turn	N
on	N
some	N
soothing	C
music	N
.	N

Candle	N
in	N
the	N
room	N
and	N
around	N
the	N
tub	N
are	N
always	N
nice	N
too	N
.	N

We	N
had	N
just	N
come	N
home	N
from	N
the	N
beach	N
one	N
Saturday	N
afternoon	N
.	N

We	N
had	N
a	N
great	N
time	N
,	N
but	N
were	N
very	N
sweaty	N
,	N
sandy	N
and	N
sticky	N
with	N
old	N
sunscreen	N
,	N
sweat	C
and	N
salt	N
from	N
the	N
ocean	N
.	N

After	N
unpacking	N
the	N
car	N
,	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N

I	N
love	N
our	N
deep	N
soaking	C
tub	N
.	N

I	N
put	N
in	N
the	N
drain	C
plug	N
and	N
started	N
running	N
the	N
water	N
,	N
making	N
sure	N
the	N
temperature	N
of	N
the	N
water	N
was	N
just	N
right	N
,	N
and	N
put	N
in	N
my	N
favorite	N
bath	N
scents	N
and	N
soap	N
.	N

When	N
the	N
tub	N
was	N
full	N
,	N
I	N
immersed	N
myself	N
deep	N
into	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
just	N
let	N
my	N
body	N
soak	C
for	N
a	N
while	N
.	N

It	N
was	N
good	N
to	N
sit	N
in	N
the	N
nice	N
,	N
warm	N
water	N
and	N
let	N
everything	N
just	N
relax	N
and	N
melt	C
away	N
from	N
me	N
.	N

I	N
washed	N
my	N
hair	N
with	N
my	N
favorite	N
shampoo	N
,	N
as	N
I	N
had	N
a	N
lot	N
of	N
sand	N
in	N
it	N
from	N
playing	N
at	N
the	N
beach	N
that	N
day	N
.	N

I	N
scrubbed	N
my	N
body	N
well	N
with	N
a	N
washcloth	N
,	N
to	N
get	N
off	N
all	N
the	N
sand	N
and	N
ocean	N
salt	N
that	N
had	N
dried	N
on	N
my	N
skin	N
,	N
along	N
with	N
the	N
sunscreen	N
that	N
I	N
had	N
been	N
using	N
.	N

It	N
was	N
very	N
relaxing	N
and	N
I	N
felt	N
really	N
good	N
.	N

I	N
then	N
pulled	N
the	N
drain	C
on	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
let	N
all	N
the	N
dirty	N
water	N
go	N
down	N
.	N

I	N
had	N
a	N
big	N
,	N
fluffy	N
bath	N
towel	N
that	N
I	N
dried	N
off	N
in	N
,	N
and	N
I	N
put	N
on	N
clean	N
clothes	N
.	N

I	N
was	N
ready	N
to	N
finish	N
up	N
our	N
fun	N
day	N
with	N
some	N
dinner	N
and	N
good	N
times	C
with	N
my	N
family	N
.	N

After	N
a	N
long	N
day	N
,	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N

I	N
changed	N
out	N
of	N
my	N
clothes	N
into	N
a	N
plush	N
bathrobe	N
.	N

I	N
placed	N
a	N
plug	N
in	N
the	N
tub	N
drain	C
so	N
the	N
tub	N
could	N
fill	N
up	N
.	N

I	N
turned	N
on	N
the	N
water	N
and	N
adjusted	N
it	N
so	N
it	N
was	N
just	N
the	N
right	N
temperature	N
-	N
hot	N
,	N
but	N
not	N
too	N
hot	N
.	N

I	N
sprinkled	N
in	N
some	N
lavender	N
scented	N
bath	N
salts	N
to	N
make	N
it	N
extra	N
relaxing	N
.	N

It	N
took	N
about	N
five	N
minutes	N
for	N
the	N
whole	N
tub	N
to	N
fill	N
up	N
.	N

I	N
did	N
n't	N
fill	N
it	N
all	N
the	N
way	N
to	N
the	N
top	N
.	N

I	N
had	N
to	N
leave	N
some	N
room	N
since	N
I	N
'd	N
be	N
getting	N
in	N
.	N

When	N
it	N
was	N
ready	N
,	N
I	N
dipped	N
my	N
toe	N
in	N
first	N
,	N
testing	N
out	N
the	N
water	N
.	N

I	N
hung	N
my	N
robe	N
on	N
the	N
back	N
of	N
the	N
door	N
,	N
and	N
got	N
into	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N

I	N
eased	N
in	N
slowly	N
since	N
the	N
water	N
was	N
hot	N
.	N

I	N
got	N
nestled	N
in	N
to	N
the	N
water	N
and	N
washed	N
myself	N
with	N
a	N
washcloth	N
and	N
soap	N
.	N

Then	N
I	N
leaned	N
my	N
head	N
against	N
the	N
rim	N
of	N
the	N
bathtub	N
.	N

I	N
breathed	N
in	N
the	N
aroma	N
of	N
lavender	N
,	N
closed	N
my	N
eyes	N
,	N
and	N
felt	N
my	N
body	N
and	N
mind	N
completely	N
relax	N
.	N

After	N
going	N
to	N
the	N
gym	N
,	N
I	N
knew	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N

I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
bathroom	N
and	N
turned	N
the	N
faucet	N
on	N
in	N
the	N
tub	N
while	N
plugging	N
the	N
drain	C
to	N
fill	N
it	N
.	N

When	N
the	N
water	N
was	N
at	N
a	N
good	N
level	N
I	N
shut	N
the	N
water	N
off	N
.	N

I	N
took	N
off	N
all	N
my	N
dirty	N
gym	N
clothes	N
.	N

I	N
then	N
made	N
sure	N
the	N
temperature	N
of	N
the	N
water	N
was	N
nice	N
and	N
warm	N
before	N
I	N
slowly	N
got	N
inside	N
.	N

I	N
soaked	C
in	N
the	N
water	N
for	N
a	N
little	N
while	N
before	N
I	N
grabbed	N
a	N
bar	N
of	N
soap	N
and	N
scrubbed	N
and	N
cleaned	N
my	N
body	N
with	N
it	N
.	N

I	N
also	N
used	N
some	N
shampoo	N
to	N
clean	N
my	N
hair	N
.	N

After	N
dipping	N
into	N
the	N
water	N
to	N
rinse	N
all	N
the	N
shampoo	N
and	N
soap	N
off	N
my	N
body	N
,	N
I	N
unplugged	N
the	N
drain	C
and	N
emptied	N
the	N
water	N
from	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N

I	N
got	N
out	N
and	N
dried	N
myself	N
with	N
a	N
towel	N
.	N

It	N
sure	N
made	N
me	N
feel	N
a	N
lot	N
better	N
to	N
be	N
clean	N
after	N
a	N
workout	N
.	N

After	N
a	N
long	N
day	N
of	N
work	N
,	N
I	N
was	N
very	N
sore	N
and	N
tired	N
.	N

I	N
had	N
stood	N
for	N
five	N
hours	N
straight	N
and	N
was	N
constantly	C
helping	N
customers	N
on	N
the	N
ground	N
floor	N
.	N

Retail	C
is	N
difficult	N
and	N
it	N
was	N
painful	N
for	N
my	N
feet	N
because	N
I	N
often	N
had	N
to	N
wear	N
high	N
heels	N
everyday	N
.	N

When	N
I	N
finally	N
got	N
home	N
from	N
work	N
,	N
I	N
put	N
my	N
stuff	N
down	N
and	N
began	N
to	N
change	N
into	N
more	N
comfortable	N
attire	N
.	N

Once	N
I	N
did	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
bathroom	N
and	N
turned	N
on	N
the	N
hot	N
water	N
to	N
prepare	N
my	N
bath	N
.	N

While	N
that	N
happened	N
,	N
I	N
washed	N
my	N
face	N
and	N
took	N
the	N
makeup	N
off	N
my	N
face	N
.	N

Once	N
I	N
cleaned	N
my	N
face	N
,	N
I	N
crawled	N
into	N
the	N
shower	N
and	N
allowed	N
the	N
hot	N
water	N
to	N
calm	N
my	N
body	N
down	N
and	N
help	N
me	N
relax	N
.	N

I	N
put	N
shampoo	N
on	N
my	N
hair	N
and	N
washed	N
my	N
hair	N
and	N
massaged	N
my	N
scalp	N
.	N

I	N
then	N
placed	N
conditioner	N
on	N
my	N
hair	N
and	N
lathered	N
it	N
all	N
over	N
my	N
hair	N
.	N

I	N
then	N
washed	N
it	N
off	N
and	N
focused	N
on	N
washing	N
my	N
body	N
.	N

After	N
washing	N
my	N
body	N
,	N
and	N
rinsing	N
off	N
the	N
soap	N
suds	N
,	N
I	N
simply	C
let	N
the	N
hot	N
water	N
go	N
all	N
over	N
my	N
body	N
and	N
allowed	N
it	N
to	N
help	N
me	N
relax	N
.	N

I	N
needed	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N

I	N
turned	N
on	N
the	N
cold	N
and	N
hot	N
taps	N
to	N
let	N
the	N
bathtub	N
fill	N
with	N
warm	N
water	N
.	N

Then	N
I	N
got	N
a	N
towel	N
and	N
draped	N
it	N
over	N
the	N
curtain	N
rod	N
.	N

I	N
took	N
off	N
my	N
clothes	N
and	N
grabbed	N
my	N
favorite	N
rubber	N
ducky	N
from	N
a	N
shelf	N
.	N

I	N
dropped	N
him	N
into	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N

If	N
I	N
needed	N
a	N
bath	N
,	N
so	N
did	N
he	N
.	N

I	N
also	N
poured	N
some	N
bubble	C
bath	N
into	N
the	N
tub	N
as	N
it	N
was	N
filling	N
with	N
water	N
.	N

It	N
foamed	N
up	N
into	N
lots	N
of	N
bubbles	N
.	N

When	N
the	N
tub	N
was	N
full	N
enough	N
,	N
I	N
turned	N
off	N
the	N
water	N
and	N
got	N
into	N
the	N
tub	N
,	N
being	N
careful	N
not	N
to	N
slip	N
on	N
the	N
slippery	C
porcelain	N
.	N

I	N
lay	N
back	N
in	N
the	N
warm	N
water	N
and	N
shut	N
my	N
eyes	N
,	N
relaxing	N
.	N

When	N
the	N
water	N
started	N
to	N
get	N
cold	N
,	N
I	N
stood	N
up	N
and	N
grabbed	N
the	N
towel	N
from	N
the	N
curtain	N
rod	N
.	N

I	N
draped	N
it	N
around	N
myself	N
and	N
then	N
opened	N
the	N
tub	N
's	N
drain	C
so	N
the	N
water	N
could	N
drain	C
out	N
.	N

I	N
went	N
off	N
to	N
get	N
dressed	N
,	N
and	N
when	N
I	N
was	N
done	N
I	N
went	N
back	N
to	N
the	N
bathroom	N
and	N
turned	N
the	N
shower	N
on	N
for	N
a	N
minute	N
so	N
the	N
bubbles	N
would	N
all	N
go	N
down	N
the	N
drain	C
.	N

I	N
picked	N
up	N
my	N
rubber	N
ducky	N
and	N
gave	N
him	N
a	N
squeeze	C
until	N
he	N
quacked	N
.	N

Then	N
I	N
put	N
him	N
on	N
the	N
shelf	N
until	N
next	N
time	N
.	N

After	N
a	N
long	N
day	N
of	N
work	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
.	N

First	N
I	N
put	N
on	N
some	N
good	N
relaxing	N
acoustic	N
music	N
to	N
listen	N
to	N
while	N
I	N
took	N
the	N
bath	N
.	N

Then	N
I	N
got	N
the	N
water	N
nice	N
and	N
hot	N
and	N
then	N
stopped	N
the	N
drain	C
.	N

After	N
the	N
tub	N
was	N
full	N
I	N
added	N
lavender	N
bubbles	N
.	N

I	N
got	N
a	N
tray	C
to	N
place	N
across	N
the	N
bath	N
with	N
my	N
wine	N
and	N
a	N
magazine	N
and	N
some	N
chocolate	N
.	N

I	N
sank	N
into	N
the	N
water	N
and	N
sighed	N
with	N
relief	C
.	N

I	N
drank	N
three	N
glasses	N
of	N
wine	N
and	N
haphazardly	N
paged	N
through	N
the	N
magazine	N
.	N

When	N
I	N
was	N
done	N
with	N
my	N
bath	N
I	N
pulled	N
the	N
plug	N
and	N
drained	N
the	N
water	N
.	N

Then	N
I	N
turned	N
on	N
the	N
shower	N
to	N
rinse	N
myself	N
off	N
.	N

Once	N
all	N
the	N
soap	N
was	N
off	N
I	N
stepped	N
out	N
.	N

I	N
dried	N
off	N
and	N
then	N
put	N
on	N
my	N
robe	N
.	N

I	N
was	N
now	N
done	N
taking	N
a	N
bath	N
and	N
was	N
ready	N
for	N
bed	N
.	N

For	N
me	N
there	N
is	N
nothing	N
more	N
relaxing	N
then	N
taking	N
a	N
nice	N
hot	N
bath	N
after	N
a	N
long	N
day	N
of	N
work	N
.	N

When	N
I	N
got	N
home	N
the	N
first	N
thing	N
I	N
did	N
was	N
start	N
the	N
running	N
water	N
in	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N

I	N
made	N
sure	N
the	N
temperature	N
was	N
perfect	N
before	N
putting	N
the	N
drain	C
stopper	N
in	N
place	N
.	N

I	N
then	N
went	N
to	N
my	N
room	N
and	N
got	N
some	N
clean	N
clothes	N
and	N
a	N
towel	N
from	N
the	N
closet	N
.	N

I	N
like	N
to	N
listen	N
to	N
music	N
when	N
I	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
so	N
I	N
brought	N
along	N
my	N
i-pod	N
and	N
small	N
speakers	N
.	N

When	N
the	N
tub	N
was	N
almost	N
filled	N
I	N
stop	N
the	N
water	N
,	N
turned	N
the	N
music	N
on	N
,	N
and	N
stepped	N
inside	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N

It	N
was	N
like	N
a	N
little	N
piece	N
of	N
heaven	C
as	N
the	N
warm	N
water	N
washed	N
over	N
my	N
body	N
.	N

After	N
about	N
10	N
minutes	N
of	N
relaxing	N
I	N
found	C
the	N
soap	N
and	N
started	N
to	N
apply	N
it	N
all	N
over	N
my	N
body	N
.	N

When	N
I	N
was	N
finished	N
I	N
pulled	N
the	N
drain	C
stopper	N
and	N
started	N
to	N
rinse	N
the	N
soap	N
off	N
.	N

After	N
all	N
the	N
water	N
was	N
drained	N
I	N
grabbed	N
my	N
towel	N
and	N
started	N
to	N
dry	N
off	N
,	N
then	N
I	N
finally	N
slipped	N
into	N
my	N
clean	N
clothes	N
.	N

It	N
was	N
so	N
relaxing	N
,	N
I	N
just	N
ca	N
n't	N
wait	N
to	N
do	N
it	N
again	N
very	N
soon	N
.	N

Last	N
week	N
,	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
nice	N
relaxing	N
bubble	C
bath	N
after	N
a	N
hard	N
day	N
of	N
work	N
.	N

After	N
getting	N
done	N
with	N
my	N
chores	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
up	N
stairs	N
into	N
the	N
bedroom	N
to	N
grab	N
some	N
clothes	N
.	N

After	N
finding	N
on	N
what	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
wear	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
into	N
the	N
bathroom	N
and	N
shut	N
the	N
door	N
.	N

I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
bath	N
tub	N
,	N
and	N
turned	N
on	N
the	N
faucet	N
.	N

I	N
messed	N
around	N
with	N
the	N
knobs	N
on	N
the	N
faucet	N
to	N
get	N
some	N
hot	N
water	N
that	N
was	N
perfect	N
temperature	N
.	N

After	N
I	N
found	C
the	N
perfect	N
temperature	N
I	N
then	N
plug	N
the	N
drain	C
and	N
then	N
put	N
a	N
small	N
amount	N
of	N
bubble	C
bath	N
into	N
the	N
tub	N
.	N

While	N
I	N
am	N
waiting	N
for	N
the	N
water	N
to	N
raise	N
,	N
I	N
take	N
off	N
my	N
clothes	N
and	N
put	N
them	N
into	N
the	N
laundry	C
basket	N
.	N

After	N
the	N
water	N
is	N
at	N
an	N
acceptable	N
level	N
,	N
I	N
turn	N
off	N
the	N
faucet	N
completely	N
.	N

I	N
then	N
turn	N
some	N
music	N
on	N
,	N
and	N
sit	N
down	N
in	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
relax	N
for	N
a	N
while	N
.	N

I	N
get	N
a	N
washcloth	N
and	N
clean	N
myself	N
up	N
everywhere	N
.	N

After	N
I	N
am	N
done	N
I	N
then	N
get	N
up	N
and	N
dry	N
myself	N
off	N
with	N
a	N
towel	N
and	N
drain	C
the	N
water	N
.	N

After	N
I	N
am	N
dried	N
I	N
put	N
my	N
new	N
clothes	N
on	N
and	N
clean	N
up	N
the	N
bathroom	N
.	N

Today	N
I	N
took	N
a	N
bath	N
in	N
my	N
new	N
apartment	N
.	N

It	N
is	N
the	N
first	N
time	N
I	N
bathed	N
there	N
so	N
I	N
need	N
to	N
get	N
my	N
things	N
ready	N
.	N

First	N
,	N
I	N
turned	N
on	N
the	N
water	N
and	N
filled	N
the	N
bath	N
up	N
with	N
nice	N
warm	N
water	N
.	N

I	N
made	N
sure	N
that	N
I	N
have	N
my	N
shampoo	N
,	N
soap	N
,	N
and	N
sponge	N
ready	N
to	N
get	N
in	N
.	N

Once	N
I	N
have	N
those	N
things	N
,	N
I	N
hang	N
my	N
towel	N
up	N
on	N
the	N
towel	N
rack	N
and	N
sink	N
into	N
the	N
splendid	C
bath	N
.	N

I	N
always	N
put	N
some	N
music	N
so	N
I	N
can	N
sing	N
along	N
in	N
the	N
shower	N
.	N

I	N
make	N
sure	N
I	N
scrub	N
real	N
good	N
,	N
especially	N
behind	N
my	N
ears	N
.	N

After	N
I	N
get	N
squeaky	C
clean	N
I	N
relax	N
for	N
a	N
little	N
while	N
longer	N
,	N
and	N
get	N
out	N
the	N
shower	N
before	N
I	N
get	N
wrinkly	N
skin	N
.	N

Once	N
Im	N
out	N
I	N
shake	N
off	N
the	N
excess	C
water	N
and	N
dry	N
my	N
body	N
real	N
good	N
with	N
the	N
towel	N
,	N
then	N
I	N
dry	N
my	N
hair	N
with	N
the	N
blow	N
dryer	N
.	N

It	N
was	N
a	N
nice	N
bath	N
.	N

I	N
thought	N
about	N
taking	N
my	N
usual	N
shower	N
today	N
,	N
but	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
bath	N
instead	N
.	N

I	N
have	N
had	N
a	N
stressful	N
week	N
and	N
the	N
relaxation	N
will	N
do	N
me	N
good	N
.	N

I	N
get	N
everything	N
ready	N
that	N
I	N
will	N
need-my	N
towel	N
,	N
my	N
bath	N
beads	N
,	N
a	N
book	N
and	N
a	N
candle	N
.	N

I	N
run	N
the	N
water	N
just	N
a	N
bit	N
on	N
the	N
warm	N
side	N
since	N
I	N
do	N
n't	N
want	N
the	N
bath	N
getting	N
cold	N
too	N
soon	N
.	N

I	N
put	N
the	N
stopper	N
in	N
on	N
the	N
bath	N
drain	C
and	N
then	N
pour	N
in	N
my	N
bath	N
beads	N
.	N

Time	N
to	N
run	N
the	N
water	N
.	N

I	N
've	N
lit	N
my	N
candle	N
and	N
grabbed	N
my	N
book	N
.	N

I	N
love	N
to	N
soak	C
for	N
a	N
bit	N
,	N
it	N
's	N
so	N
relaxing	N
.	N

I	N
will	N
get	N
through	N
a	N
chapter	N
or	N
two	N
of	N
my	N
book	N
,	N
depending	N
how	N
fast	N
I	N
feel	N
like	N
reading	N
.	N

The	N
whole	N
atmosphere	N
is	N
de-stressing	N
me	N
.	N

After	N
my	N
bath	N
,	N
I	N
will	N
towel	N
off	N
and	N
get	N
into	N
my	N
pajamas	N
.	N

I	N
always	N
seem	N
to	N
sleep	N
better	N
after	N
taking	N
a	N
relaxing	N
bath	N
.	N

As	N
a	N
child	N
,	N
I	N
loved	N
taking	N
baths	N
.	N

My	N
mother	N
always	N
had	N
to	N
fill	N
the	N
tub	N
for	N
me	N
so	N
that	N
the	N
water	N
would	N
not	N
be	N
too	N
hot	N
or	N
too	N
cold	N
.	N

I	N
'd	N
say	N
that	N
the	N
ideal	C
temperature	N
for	N
the	N
water	N
was	N
about	N
90	N
degrees	N
.	N

My	N
favorite	N
part	N
of	N
taking	N
a	N
bath	N
was	N
the	N
bubbles	N
.	N

I	N
loved	N
to	N
splash	C
around	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
play	N
with	N
the	N
bubbles	N
.	N

Once	N
I	N
sat	N
in	N
the	N
tub	N
,	N
I	N
used	N
shampoo	N
to	N
wash	N
my	N
hair	N
and	N
a	N
washed	N
my	N
body	N
with	N
a	N
soapy	N
washcloth	N
.	N

I	N
made	N
sure	N
to	N
wash	N
behind	N
my	N
ears	N
and	N
on	N
my	N
face	N
as	N
well	N
.	N

Once	N
I	N
was	N
clean	N
,	N
I	N
would	N
play	N
with	N
my	N
bath	N
toys	N
for	N
a	N
little	N
while	N
.	N

After	N
some	N
time	N
has	N
passed	N
,	N
I	N
drained	N
the	N
water	N
.	N

After	N
draining	N
the	N
water	N
,	N
I	N
would	N
stand	N
up	N
and	N
dry	N
myself	N
off	N
with	N
a	N
towel	N
.	N

I	N
enjoyed	N
taking	N
baths	N
because	N
I	N
often	N
needed	N
to	N
be	N
cleaned	N
,	N
I	N
loved	N
to	N
play	N
outside	N
as	N
a	N
kid	N
.	N

I	N
ride	N
my	N
bike	N
to	N
work	N
everyday	N
.	N

I	N
also	N
ride	N
for	N
pleasure	N
on	N
the	N
weekends	N
.	N

This	N
morning	N
I	N
was	N
pedaling	N
along	N
and	N
all	N
of	N
the	N
sudden	C
I	N
could	N
feel	N
the	N
gritty	N
pavement	N
scraping	N
the	N
rim	N
.	N

I	N
got	N
off	N
the	N
bike	N
and	N
sure	N
enough	N
the	N
front	N
tire	C
was	N
flat	N
.	N

Well	N
that	N
is	N
bad	N
but	N
not	N
as	N
bad	N
if	N
the	N
rear	C
tire	C
was	N
flat	N
and	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
take	N
the	N
chain	N
off	N
.	N

I	N
always	N
carry	N
a	N
spare	N
inner	C
tube	N
and	N
have	N
a	N
pump	N
on	N
the	N
frame	N
of	N
my	N
bike	N
.	N

This	N
was	N
going	N
to	N
be	N
easy	N
as	N
I	N
have	N
done	N
this	N
many	N
times	C
before	N
.	N

I	N
loosened	N
the	N
lock	N
nuts	N
that	N
hold	N
the	N
front	N
tire	C
in	N
place	N
and	N
pulled	N
the	N
tire	C
from	N
the	N
frame	N
.	N

I	N
looked	N
in	N
my	N
bike	N
pack	N
and	N
found	C
the	N
tool	C
that	N
helps	N
take	N
the	N
tire	C
off	N
the	N
rim	N
.	N

This	N
took	N
all	N
of	N
5	N
minutes	N
.	N

When	N
I	N
had	N
that	N
off	N
I	N
took	N
the	N
old	N
inner	C
tube	N
and	N
placed	N
it	N
in	N
my	N
backpack	N
to	N
patch	C
later	N
.	N

I	N
then	N
fit	N
the	N
good	N
inner	C
tube	N
inside	N
the	N
tire	C
and	N
in	N
reverse	C
order	N
fitted	N
the	N
tire	C
to	N
the	N
rim	N
.	N

I	N
next	N
took	N
my	N
pump	N
and	N
filled	N
it	N
up	N
to	N
the	N
correct	N
pressure	C
.	N

I	N
put	N
the	N
tire	C
back	N
on	N
the	N
front	N
fork	N
and	N
tightened	N
the	N
locking	N
nuts	N
and	N
was	N
on	N
my	N
way	N
.	N

I	N
was	N
n't	N
even	N
late	N
for	N
work	N
.	N

The	N
other	N
day	N
,	N
my	N
best	N
friend	N
and	N
I	N
were	N
riding	N
to	N
his	N
house	N
.	N

When	N
we	N
were	N
almost	N
there	N
,	N
I	N
noticed	N
that	N
the	N
front	N
tire	C
on	N
my	N
bicycle	N
felt	N
rather	N
wobbly	N
and	N
was	N
most	N
likely	N
flat	N
.	N

I	N
was	N
in	N
luck	N
however	N
,	N
as	N
my	N
friend	N
had	N
a	N
bicycle	N
repair	N
kit	N
and	N
some	N
spare	N
tires	N
.	N

Once	N
we	N
arrived	N
at	N
my	N
friend	N
's	N
house	N
,	N
I	N
asked	N
my	N
friend	N
if	N
he	N
let	N
me	N
borrow	N
his	N
bicycle	N
repair	N
kit	N
.	N

First	N
,	N
I	N
turned	N
the	N
bike	N
over	N
and	N
removed	N
the	N
front	N
tire	C
and	N
tube	N
.	N

Next	N
I	N
filled	N
the	N
tube	N
with	N
air	N
to	N
check	N
where	N
the	N
tube	N
was	N
damaged	N
,	N
and	N
found	C
a	N
small	N
glass	N
shard	N
which	N
had	N
punctured	N
through	N
it	N
.	N

After	N
making	N
ensure	C
the	N
tube	N
was	N
fully	N
deflated	N
,	N
I	N
repaired	N
the	N
puncture	N
in	N
the	N
tube	N
by	N
using	N
glue	C
and	N
applying	N
a	N
patch	C
on	N
top	N
,	N
then	N
slid	N
it	N
back	N
onto	N
the	N
tire	C
using	N
my	N
hands	N
.	N

Next	N
,	N
I	N
placed	N
and	N
pushed	N
the	N
tire	C
back	N
onto	N
the	N
tube	N
.	N

After	N
which	N
,	N
I	N
reconnected	N
the	N
tire	C
onto	N
the	N
bicycle	N
.	N

Finally	N
,	N
I	N
pumped	N
air	N
into	N
the	N
tire	C
until	N
it	N
was	N
filled	N
up	N
and	N
the	N
bicycle	N
was	N
ready	N
to	N
be	N
ridden	N
again	N
.	N

My	N
bike	N
tire	C
was	N
flat	N
so	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
bike	N
shop	N
and	N
bought	N
a	N
replacement	C
.	N

I	N
first	N
took	N
the	N
old	N
tire	C
off	N
of	N
my	N
bike	N
.	N

Then	N
I	N
set	N
my	N
bike	N
on	N
a	N
rack	N
to	N
that	N
the	N
flat	N
tire	C
would	N
be	N
easy	N
to	N
get	N
to	N
.	N

Then	N
I	N
put	N
the	N
new	N
tire	C
around	N
the	N
wheel	N
to	N
see	N
if	N
it	N
fits	N
.	N

It	N
did	N
.	N

Then	N
I	N
put	N
the	N
new	N
tire	C
into	N
the	N
grooves	N
inside	N
the	N
wheel	N
.	N

Then	N
I	N
walked	N
with	N
my	N
bike	N
to	N
the	N
gas	N
station	N
just	N
around	N
the	N
corner	N
to	N
fill	N
it	N
up	N
with	N
air	N
.	N

I	N
put	N
a	N
quarter	N
into	N
the	N
air	N
machine	N
and	N
put	N
my	N
bike	N
next	N
to	N
the	N
air	N
hose	N
and	N
filled	N
the	N
tire	C
up	N
.	N

I	N
checked	N
the	N
air	N
pressure	C
with	N
a	N
gauge	N
and	N
it	N
was	N
alright	N
.	N

I	N
felt	N
around	N
the	N
tire	C
to	N
make	N
sure	N
that	N
it	N
was	N
solidly	N
in	N
place	N
and	N
it	N
was	N
.	N

While	N
I	N
was	N
out	N
riding	N
my	N
bike	N
one	N
warm	N
spring	N
day	N
,	N
one	N
of	N
the	N
tires	N
went	N
flat	N
.	N

Fortunately	N
I	N
had	N
a	N
repair	N
kit	N
with	N
me	N
in	N
a	N
pouch	N
on	N
the	N
bike	N
.	N

I	N
always	N
kept	N
it	N
with	N
me	N
on	N
rides	N
just	N
in	N
case	N
of	N
such	C
an	N
occurrence	C
.	N

I	N
got	N
off	N
and	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
side	N
of	N
the	N
trail	C
out	N
of	N
the	N
way	N
of	N
other	N
bikers	N
and	N
runners	N
.	N

I	N
lay	N
the	N
bike	N
on	N
its	N
side	N
and	N
got	N
the	N
repair	N
kit	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
pouch	N
.	N

The	N
repair	N
kit	N
contained	N
a	N
new	N
inner	C
tube	N
which	N
I	N
inflated	N
.	N

I	N
then	N
pulled	N
the	N
outer	C
tire	C
off	N
of	N
the	N
inner	C
tube	N
.	N

I	N
replaced	N
the	N
flattened	N
inner	C
tube	N
with	N
the	N
new	N
one	N
and	N
replaced	N
the	N
outer	C
tire	C
over	N
it	N
.	N

I	N
rode	N
off	N
slowly	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
everything	N
was	N
correctly	N
in	N
place	N
.	N

Once	N
I	N
got	N
home	N
,	N
I	N
replaced	N
the	N
spare	N
tire	C
kit	N
with	N
a	N
new	N
one	N
so	N
that	N
I	N
would	N
be	N
prepared	N
on	N
my	N
next	N
ride	N
.	N

I	N
was	N
going	N
to	N
go	N
on	N
a	N
bike	N
ride	N
with	N
a	N
friend	N
.	N

I	N
pulled	N
my	N
bike	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
garage	N
only	N
to	N
discover	N
I	N
had	N
a	N
flat	N
tire	C
.	N

I	N
was	N
n't	N
sure	N
if	N
the	N
flat	N
was	N
just	N
from	N
a	N
slow	N
leak	C
or	N
a	N
bad	N
tube	N
.	N

If	N
it	N
was	N
from	N
a	N
bad	N
tube	N
I	N
would	N
have	N
to	N
use	N
tools	N
to	N
take	N
the	N
tire	C
completely	N
off	N
.	N

Then	N
I	N
would	N
have	N
to	N
replace	N
the	N
tube	N
.	N

If	N
it	N
was	N
just	N
a	N
slow	N
leak	C
I	N
could	N
just	N
inflate	N
the	N
tire	C
with	N
my	N
air	N
pump	N
and	N
be	N
on	N
my	N
way	N
.	N

I	N
decided	N
to	N
try	N
the	N
easy	N
route	N
first	N
and	N
inflated	N
the	N
tire	C
with	N
the	N
pump	N
.	N

It	N
felt	N
as	N
if	N
the	N
tire	C
was	N
full	N
and	N
the	N
problem	N
was	N
solved	N
.	N

I	N
took	N
the	N
bike	N
for	N
a	N
test	N
ride	N
around	N
the	N
neighborhood	N
just	N
to	N
be	N
sure	N
that	N
it	N
was	N
fully	N
inflated	N
and	N
would	N
stay	N
that	N
way	N
.	N

It	N
stayed	N
inflated	N
and	N
I	N
set	N
off	N
to	N
meet	N
with	N
my	N
friend	N
.	N

If	N
you	N
have	N
a	N
flat	N
tire	C
it	N
is	N
quite	N
easy	N
to	N
change	N
it	N
yourself	N
.	N

The	N
front	N
tire	C
is	N
the	N
easiest	N
to	N
change	N
while	N
the	N
back	N
will	N
require	N
more	N
time	N
and	N
maybe	N
additional	C
tools	N
.	N

This	N
is	N
usually	N
the	N
back	N
tire	C
is	N
where	N
the	N
chain	N
and	N
gears	N
are	N
connected	N
to	N
so	N
it	N
is	N
harder	N
to	N
take	N
off	N
the	N
bike	N
frame	N
.	N

Sadly	C
,	N
most	N
of	N
the	N
time	N
a	N
flat	N
tire	C
is	N
the	N
back	N
tire	C
because	N
the	N
back	N
tire	C
supports	N
most	N
of	N
your	N
weight	N
on	N
a	N
bicycle	N
.	N

So	N
you	N
'll	N
need	N
a	N
wrench	N
to	N
undo	C
the	N
bolts	N
on	N
both	N
sides	N
of	N
the	N
tire	C
.	N

This	N
will	N
allow	N
you	N
to	N
take	N
off	N
the	N
entire	C
tire	C
.	N

Inside	N
the	N
tire	C
is	N
an	N
innertube	N
,	N
and	N
this	N
is	N
the	N
part	N
you	N
either	N
need	N
to	N
replace	N
or	N
patch	C
up	N
.	N

If	N
it	N
is	N
a	N
small	N
hole	N
and	N
you	N
can	N
easily	N
find	N
the	N
hole	N
,	N
you	N
can	N
use	N
a	N
tire	C
patch	C
kit	N
to	N
fix	N
the	N
hole	N
.	N

Other	N
wise	C
you	N
may	N
just	N
replace	N
the	N
entire	C
innertube	N
altogether	N
.	N

Either	N
way	N
you	N
will	N
put	N
the	N
innertube	N
back	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
the	N
tire	C
back	N
onto	N
the	N
bike	N
frame	N
.	N

Lastly	C
,	N
screw	N
back	N
on	N
the	N
bolts	N
and	N
pump	N
some	N
air	N
into	N
the	N
tire	C
.	N

You	N
'll	N
be	N
ready	N
to	N
ride	N
soon	N
after	N
!	N
One	N
day	N
my	N
bicycle	N
tire	C
got	N
flat	N
due	N
to	N
hitting	N
some	N
glass	N
in	N
the	N
street	N
.	N

I	N
then	N
had	N
to	N
walk	N
the	N
rest	N
of	N
the	N
way	N
home	N
.	N

I	N
took	N
it	N
into	N
my	N
garage	N
and	N
tried	N
to	N
repair	N
it	N
by	N
putting	N
some	N
duct	N
tape	N
on	N
it	N
and	N
pumping	N
it	N
with	N
air	N
.	N

This	N
,	N
however	N
,	N
only	N
made	N
matters	N
worst	N
and	N
all	N
the	N
air	N
ended	N
up	N
making	N
another	N
hole	N
in	N
my	N
tire	C
because	N
I	N
over	N
inflated	N
it	N
.	N

I	N
decided	N
that	N
I	N
had	N
no	N
other	N
options	N
and	N
I	N
ordered	N
a	N
new	N
tire	C
on	N
Amazon	N
for	N
my	N
bike	N
.	N

Once	N
that	N
came	N
in	N
the	N
mail	N
it	N
was	N
time	N
to	N
repair	N
my	N
broken	N
bike	N
.	N

I	N
got	N
a	N
socket	N
wrench	N
and	N
unscrewed	N
the	N
nut	C
of	N
the	N
bike	N
that	N
attached	N
to	N
the	N
wheel	N
.	N

After	N
that	N
I	N
got	N
my	N
new	N
bike	N
tire	C
and	N
put	N
it	N
on	N
the	N
frame	N
of	N
the	N
bike	N
and	N
screwed	N
it	N
back	N
on	N
.	N

Once	N
that	N
was	N
complete	N
my	N
bike	N
was	N
as	N
good	N
as	N
new	N
and	N
I	N
was	N
back	N
to	N
riding	N
my	N
daily	N
bike	N
trail	C
by	N
my	N
house	N
.	N

my	N
sister	N
Jane	N
and	N
I	N
love	N
to	N
go	N
bicycling	N
.	N

One	N
warm	N
day	N
in	N
June	N
,	N
we	N
wanted	N
to	N
go	N
out	N
and	N
ride	N
but	N
my	N
bike	N
had	N
a	N
flat	N
tire	C
.	N

I	N
carefully	N
took	N
the	N
tire	C
off	N
of	N
the	N
rim	N
and	N
then	N
inflated	N
it	N
with	N
a	N
hand	N
pump	N
so	N
I	N
could	N
find	N
the	N
leak	C
.	N

A	N
blast	N
of	N
cool	N
air	N
on	N
my	N
fingers	N
led	N
me	N
to	N
the	N
problem	N
:	N
a	N
single	N
round	N
hole	N
,	N
probably	N
caused	N
by	N
a	N
nail	C
or	N
other	N
sharp	N
object	N
.	N

I	N
got	N
out	N
my	N
patch	C
kit	N
,	N
and	N
Jane	N
held	N
up	N
the	N
tire	C
for	N
me	N
as	N
I	N
first	N
applied	N
glue	C
and	N
then	N
placed	N
a	N
patch	C
carefully	N
over	N
the	N
damaged	N
area	N
.	N

I	N
had	N
to	N
let	N
it	N
dry	N
,	N
so	N
we	N
took	N
turns	N
riding	N
Jane	N
's	N
bike	N
for	N
a	N
while	N
.	N

Then	N
I	N
inflated	N
the	N
tire	C
and	N
checked	N
the	N
patch	C
.	N

It	N
was	N
good	N
!	N
The	N
leak	C
was	N
repaired	N
.	N

I	N
put	N
the	N
tire	C
back	N
on	N
my	N
bike	N
and	N
we	N
went	N
off	N
on	N
a	N
nice	N
long	N
ride	N
.	N

I	N
was	N
happy	N
to	N
have	N
my	N
bike	N
fixed	C
again	N
.	N

I	N
was	N
about	N
to	N
go	N
for	N
a	N
bicycle	N
ride	N
,	N
but	N
when	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
garage	N
to	N
get	N
my	N
bike	N
I	N
realized	N
the	N
tire	C
was	N
completely	N
flat	N
.	N

Luckily	N
I	N
was	N
prepared	N
for	N
just	N
such	C
an	N
event	N
.	N

I	N
went	N
to	N
a	N
shelf	N
and	N
found	C
my	N
bicycle	N
repair	N
kit	N
.	N

Then	N
I	N
took	N
a	N
close	N
look	N
at	N
the	N
bicycle	N
tire	C
.	N

If	N
I	N
could	N
n't	N
find	N
the	N
leak	C
,	N
I	N
could	N
always	N
fill	N
a	N
tub	N
with	N
water	N
,	N
put	N
the	N
tire	C
under	N
the	N
water	N
and	N
see	N
where	N
the	N
bubbles	N
come	N
out	N
.	N

Luckily	N
the	N
leak	C
was	N
obvious	N
.	N

I	N
applied	N
some	N
adhesive	N
from	N
the	N
kit	N
and	N
put	N
on	N
a	N
rubber	N
patch	C
.	N

Then	N
I	N
got	N
down	N
my	N
bicycle	N
pump	N
.	N

I	N
hooked	N
the	N
hose	N
up	N
to	N
the	N
nipple	N
on	N
the	N
tire	C
and	N
then	N
pumped	N
up	N
and	N
down	N
vigorously	N
for	N
a	N
few	N
minutes	N
.	N

I	N
felt	N
the	N
tire	C
.	N

It	N
was	N
nice	N
and	N
firm	N
.	N

Success	N
!	N
I	N
put	N
away	N
the	N
pump	N
and	N
kit	N
and	N
hopped	N
on	N
for	N
my	N
bike	N
ride	N
.	N

Once	N
,	N
when	N
I	N
was	N
12	N
,	N
I	N
had	N
a	N
flat	N
bicycle	N
tire	C
.	N

I	N
had	N
ridden	N
over	N
a	N
nail	C
and	N
my	N
tire	C
was	N
punctured	N
and	N
my	N
tube	N
popped	N
.	N

In	N
order	N
to	N
fix	N
it	N
my	N
brother	N
took	N
me	N
the	N
store	N
so	N
I	N
could	N
buy	N
a	N
patch	C
to	N
fix	N
the	N
tire	C
.	N

Once	N
we	N
got	N
the	N
patch	C
,	N
we	N
went	N
back	N
to	N
the	N
house	N
.	N

In	N
order	N
to	N
find	N
the	N
hole	N
we	N
filled	N
the	N
tub	N
with	N
water	N
and	N
put	N
the	N
tube	N
in	N
.	N

We	N
looked	N
to	N
see	N
where	N
bubbles	N
came	N
out	N
;	N
where	N
the	N
bubbles	N
came	N
out	N
told	N
us	N
where	N
the	N
hole	N
was	N
.	N

Once	N
we	N
noted	N
the	N
location	N
of	N
the	N
hole	N
we	N
took	N
the	N
tube	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
tub	N
and	N
dried	N
it	N
.	N

To	N
put	N
on	N
the	N
patch	C
we	N
had	N
to	N
put	N
a	N
glue	C
on	N
the	N
tube	N
and	N
then	N
put	N
on	N
the	N
patch	C
.	N

We	N
held	N
it	N
there	N
a	N
few	N
minutes	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
it	N
would	N
stay	N
,	N
then	N
we	N
let	N
it	N
sit	N
for	N
an	N
hour	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
the	N
glue	C
would	N
dry	N
.	N

To	N
make	N
sure	N
it	N
dried	N
well	N
we	N
placed	N
the	N
tube	N
out	N
in	N
the	N
sun	N
so	N
the	N
the	N
heat	N
could	N
help	N
it	N
along	N
.	N

To	N
be	N
safe	N
we	N
waited	N
a	N
day	N
.	N

The	N
next	N
day	N
we	N
took	N
the	N
tube	N
and	N
put	N
it	N
back	N
in	N
the	N
tire	C
,	N
then	N
we	N
put	N
the	N
tire	C
on	N
the	N
wheel	N
.	N

My	N
bike	N
was	N
good	N
to	N
ride	N
again	N
.	N

I	N
was	N
riding	N
in	N
the	N
bike	N
lane	C
going	N
to	N
work	N
when	N
I	N
felt	N
my	N
tire	C
pop	N
and	N
give	N
out	N
on	N
me	N
.	N

I	N
quickly	N
pulled	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
side	N
walk	N
and	N
got	N
off	N
my	N
bike	N
to	N
take	N
a	N
good	N
look	N
at	N
it	N
.	N

A	N
rock	N
was	N
embedded	N
into	N
my	N
tire	C
tube	N
.	N

I	N
pried	N
the	N
rock	N
out	N
with	N
my	N
fingers	N
and	N
got	N
my	N
patch	C
kit	N
from	N
my	N
backpack	N
.	N

I	N
made	N
sure	N
there	N
was	N
no	N
other	N
debris	N
in	N
the	N
tire	C
and	N
then	N
applied	N
the	N
glue	C
.	N

I	N
stuck	C
the	N
patch	C
onto	N
the	N
glue	C
and	N
made	N
sure	N
it	N
was	N
a	N
nice	N
fit	N
and	N
held	N
well	N
.	N

After	N
that	N
i	N
pumped	N
my	N
tire	C
back	N
up	N
with	N
air	N
and	N
checked	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
it	N
would	N
hold	N
up	N
to	N
the	N
rigors	N
of	N
the	N
road	N
.	N

After	N
that	N
I	N
hopped	N
back	N
on	N
my	N
bike	N
and	N
slowly	N
rode	N
to	N
work	N
careful	N
of	N
anymore	N
rocks	N
.	N

I	N
got	N
to	N
work	N
on	N
time	N
.	N

This	N
is	N
why	N
i	N
always	N
carry	N
around	N
my	N
repair	N
kit	N
.	N

The	N
other	N
day	N
my	N
dad	N
was	N
riding	N
his	N
bike	N
and	N
started	N
having	N
trouble	N
steering	N
.	N

He	N
rode	N
the	N
bike	N
back	N
home	N
and	N
then	N
took	N
it	N
into	N
the	N
back	N
yard	N
to	N
have	N
a	N
look	N
at	N
it	N
.	N

He	N
noticed	N
that	N
the	N
front	N
tire	C
was	N
flat	N
and	N
was	N
n't	N
keeping	N
air	N
in	N
it	N
.	N

He	N
took	N
it	N
off	N
the	N
bike	N
.	N

First	N
he	N
pumped	N
it	N
up	N
and	N
tried	N
to	N
see	N
if	N
the	N
tire	C
would	N
hold	N
air	N
.	N

It	N
would	N
not	N
.	N

Then	N
he	N
rubbed	N
liquid	N
dish	N
detergent	N
on	N
the	N
tire	C
and	N
pumped	N
it	N
up	N
and	N
looked	N
for	N
where	N
it	N
bubbled	N
to	N
see	N
where	N
the	N
hole	N
was	N
.	N

Once	N
he	N
found	C
the	N
hole	N
,	N
he	N
decided	N
if	N
it	N
needed	N
a	N
patch	C
or	N
a	N
plug	N
.	N

It	N
was	N
a	N
small	N
round	N
hole	N
so	N
he	N
decided	N
to	N
put	N
a	N
plug	N
in	N
it	N
.	N

He	N
got	N
the	N
packages	N
of	N
plugs	N
and	N
found	C
one	N
that	N
was	N
the	N
right	N
size	N
.	N

He	N
followed	N
the	N
instructs	N
on	N
the	N
package	C
to	N
insert	C
the	N
plug	N
into	N
the	N
hole	N
and	N
secure	C
it	N
.	N

He	N
pumped	N
the	N
tire	C
back	N
up	N
and	N
it	N
held	N
air	N
.	N

He	N
put	N
the	N
tire	C
back	N
on	N
the	N
bike	N
.	N

My	N
husband	N
was	N
riding	N
down	N
a	N
steep	N
hill	N
a	N
few	N
miles	C
from	N
home	N
when	N
he	N
got	N
a	N
blow	N
out	N
.	N

He	N
called	N
me	N
to	N
come	N
and	N
get	N
him	N
.	N

Luckily	N
he	N
was	N
n't	N
hurt	N
.	N

He	N
had	N
the	N
bicycle	N
repair	N
kit	N
on	N
him	N
.	N

We	N
took	N
the	N
tire	C
off	N
with	N
some	N
tools	N
.	N

We	N
took	N
the	N
inner	C
tube	N
out	N
.	N

He	N
checked	N
the	N
inner	C
tube	N
for	N
holes	N
by	N
putting	N
air	N
in	N
it	N
.	N

He	N
found	C
the	N
hole	N
and	N
marked	N
it	N
.	N

That	N
is	N
the	N
place	N
where	N
he	N
put	N
the	N
patch	C
and	N
glued	N
it	N
.	N

My	N
husband	N
put	N
the	N
tube	N
back	N
in	N
the	N
bicycle	N
.	N

The	N
frame	N
was	N
a	N
little	N
bent	N
but	N
the	N
bike	N
was	N
okay	N
.	N

I	N
followed	N
him	N
for	N
a	N
little	N
while	N
.	N

He	N
was	N
almost	N
to	N
the	N
park	N
so	N
I	N
met	N
him	N
there	N
.	N

After	N
a	N
while	N
we	N
put	N
the	N
bike	N
in	N
the	N
back	N
of	N
the	N
truck	N
and	N
drove	N
home	N
.	N

I	N
went	N
out	N
to	N
my	N
garage	N
to	N
get	N
my	N
bike	N
to	N
go	N
on	N
a	N
ride	N
.	N

When	N
I	N
saw	N
my	N
bike	N
I	N
realized	N
that	N
one	N
of	N
the	N
tires	N
were	N
flat	N
.	N

I	N
needed	N
to	N
buy	N
a	N
new	N
tube	N
in	N
order	N
to	N
fix	N
the	N
flat	N
.	N

I	N
drove	N
to	N
the	N
local	N
bike	N
shop	N
and	N
purchased	N
a	N
tube	N
that	N
would	N
fit	N
my	N
bike	N
's	N
tire	C
and	N
then	N
I	N
drove	N
back	N
home	N
.	N

I	N
took	N
the	N
tube	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
packaging	N
and	N
read	N
the	N
instructions	N
on	N
how	N
to	N
put	N
it	N
on	N
the	N
bike	N
.	N

I	N
removed	N
the	N
tire	C
from	N
the	N
bike	N
and	N
took	N
out	N
the	N
old	N
tube	N
that	N
was	N
punctured	N
.	N

I	N
then	N
inserted	N
the	N
new	N
tube	N
onto	N
the	N
tire	C
.	N

I	N
put	N
the	N
tire	C
back	N
on	N
the	N
bike	N
and	N
pumped	N
up	N
the	N
tube	N
with	N
air	N
until	N
it	N
was	N
filled	N
to	N
the	N
desired	N
fill	N
weight	N
.	N

I	N
got	N
on	N
the	N
bike	N
to	N
test	N
it	N
and	N
it	N
was	N
in	N
great	N
shape	N
.	N

Then	N
I	N
took	N
off	N
on	N
my	N
bike	N
ride	N
.	N

Yesterday	N
,	N
my	N
bike	N
tire	C
popped	N
while	N
I	N
was	N
riding	N
it	N
.	N

I	N
had	N
to	N
walk	N
45	N
min	N
home	N
to	N
get	N
it	N
fixed	C
.	N

I	N
had	N
tried	N
riding	N
it	N
with	N
a	N
flat	N
tire	C
,	N
but	N
the	N
bike	N
dragged	N
on	N
the	N
cement	N
and	N
I	N
did	N
n't	N
have	N
the	N
man	N
power	N
to	N
turn	N
the	N
wheels	N
.	N

When	N
,	N
I	N
got	N
home	N
I	N
asked	N
my	N
father	N
for	N
help	N
.	N

We	N
inflated	N
the	N
tire	C
a	N
little	N
with	N
a	N
mechanical	C
pump	N
.	N

You	N
grab	N
the	N
pump	N
with	N
two	N
hands	N
,	N
pull	N
the	N
lever	N
up	N
and	N
then	N
push	N
down	N
with	N
your	N
whole	N
body	N
weight	N
.	N

We	N
put	N
the	N
tire	C
underwater	C
to	N
find	N
where	N
bubbles	N
were	N
coming	N
out	N
to	N
find	N
the	N
hole	N
.	N

After	N
we	N
found	C
the	N
hole	N
,	N
we	N
dried	N
the	N
tire	C
and	N
sprayed	N
a	N
rubber	N
sealant	N
to	N
the	N
tire	C
to	N
seal	C
the	N
hole	N
.	N

Afterwards	N
,	N
we	N
inflated	N
the	N
tire	C
.	N

Then	N
,	N
I	N
got	N
on	N
it	N
to	N
see	N
if	N
it	N
worked	N
.	N

After	N
a	N
day	N
or	N
so	N
,	N
I	N
rode	N
it	N
again	N
to	N
make	N
sure	N
the	N
tire	C
was	N
n't	N
deflating	N
.	N

Yesterday	N
,	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
ride	N
my	N
bike	N
because	N
the	N
weather	N
was	N
so	N
nice	N
.	N

I	N
got	N
my	N
bike	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
storage	C
closet	N
and	N
noticed	N
it	N
had	N
a	N
flat	N
tire	C
.	N

Since	N
I	N
do	N
not	N
have	N
a	N
spare	N
tire	C
,	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
fix	N
it	N
if	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
ride	N
.	N

I	N
found	C
my	N
bike	N
pump	N
and	N
patch	C
kit	N
.	N

I	N
pumped	N
the	N
tire	C
and	N
was	N
able	C
to	N
locate	C
the	N
air	N
leak	C
.	N

I	N
took	N
out	N
the	N
patch	C
and	N
applied	N
it	N
to	N
the	N
part	N
of	N
the	N
tire	C
that	N
had	N
the	N
little	N
leak	C
.	N

I	N
then	N
pumped	N
the	N
tire	C
again	N
.	N

I	N
had	N
to	N
be	N
careful	N
not	N
to	N
overfill	N
the	N
tire	C
so	N
the	N
patch	C
would	N
n't	N
pop	N
off	N
.	N

Once	N
I	N
was	N
sure	N
the	N
patch	C
would	N
n't	N
come	N
off	N
,	N
I	N
made	N
sure	N
that	N
I	N
pumped	N
the	N
air	N
into	N
the	N
tire	C
sufficiently	C
.	N

I	N
tested	N
the	N
tire	C
by	N
sitting	N
on	N
the	N
bike	N
and	N
riding	N
around	N
a	N
little	N
.	N

The	N
tire	C
seemed	N
to	N
hold	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
was	N
ready	N
to	N
go	N
on	N
my	N
bike	N
ride	N
.	N

It	N
was	N
such	C
a	N
nice	N
day	N
and	N
I	N
had	N
a	N
great	N
day	N
riding	N
my	N
bike	N
.	N

Yesterday	N
while	N
I	N
was	N
riding	N
my	N
bike	N
I	N
got	N
a	N
flat	N
tire	C
.	N

Luckily	N
I	N
had	N
a	N
tire	C
repair	N
kit	N
in	N
the	N
garage	N
.	N

It	N
's	N
very	N
easy	N
to	N
do	N
.	N

The	N
first	N
thing	N
I	N
did	N
was	N
use	N
a	N
flathead	N
screwdriver	N
to	N
pop	N
the	N
tire	C
off	N
of	N
the	N
rim	N
.	N

The	N
tire	C
is	N
hollow	C
inside	N
,	N
with	N
no	N
tube	N
.	N

The	N
patch	C
kit	N
contains	N
small	N
rubber	N
patches	N
with	N
glue	C
,	N
that	N
you	N
use	N
to	N
seal	C
up	N
any	N
holes	N
that	N
might	N
appear	N
.	N

When	N
I	N
had	N
the	N
tire	C
off	N
the	N
rim	N
I	N
looked	N
all	N
around	N
inside	N
to	N
find	N
the	N
hole	N
.	N

When	N
I	N
found	C
it	N
,	N
I	N
used	N
a	N
special	N
piece	N
of	N
sandpaper	N
inside	N
the	N
repair	N
kit	N
to	N
clean	N
off	N
the	N
area	N
around	N
the	N
hole	N
,	N
so	N
the	N
glue	C
would	N
stick	N
nicely	C
.	N

I	N
then	N
applied	N
the	N
glue	C
and	N
put	N
one	N
of	N
the	N
small	N
rubber	N
patches	N
onto	N
it	N
.	N

The	N
instructions	N
said	N
to	N
let	N
it	N
dry	N
for	N
a	N
few	N
hours	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
went	N
inside	N
and	N
watched	N
TV	N
.	N

After	N
awhile	N
I	N
came	N
back	N
out	N
and	N
put	N
the	N
tire	C
back	N
on	N
the	N
rim	N
,	N
then	N
used	N
a	N
pump	N
to	N
pump	N
the	N
tire	C
full	N
of	N
air	N
.	N

Sure	N
enough	N
,	N
it	N
fixed	C
the	N
hole	N
!	N
Riding	N
my	N
bike	N
through	N
the	N
park	N
,	N
I	N
was	N
enjoying	N
the	N
beautiful	N
spring	N
scenery	N
.	N

A	N
family	N
of	N
squirrels	N
caught	N
my	N
attention	N
and	N
I	N
was	N
looking	N
at	N
them	N
when	N
I	N
hit	N
some	N
broken	N
glass	N
.	N

My	N
bike	N
's	N
tire	C
immediately	N
deflated	N
.	N

I	N
walked	N
it	N
back	N
to	N
my	N
car	N
,	N
loaded	N
up	N
,	N
and	N
headed	N
for	N
a	N
local	N
department	N
store	N
.	N

Sure	N
enough	N
,	N
they	N
had	N
bike	N
tire	C
repair	N
kits	N
in	N
the	N
sporting	N
goods	N
section	N
.	N

I	N
bought	N
one	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
headed	N
on	N
home	N
.	N

Once	N
there	N
I	N
removed	N
a	N
wheel	N
from	N
the	N
bike	N
.	N

From	N
it	N
I	N
took	N
out	N
the	N
inner	C
tube	N
.	N

I	N
rubbed	N
some	N
soapy	N
water	N
on	N
it	N
and	N
quickly	N
found	C
the	N
problem	N
spot	N
.	N

From	N
my	N
new	N
repair	N
kit	N
I	N
found	C
a	N
special	N
patch	C
.	N

I	N
applied	N
the	N
sealant	N
and	N
then	N
stuck	C
the	N
patch	C
on	N
.	N

I	N
used	N
a	N
hair	N
dryer	N
to	N
heat	N
and	N
set	N
it	N
.	N

Next	N
,	N
I	N
took	N
out	N
the	N
air	N
compressor	N
and	N
reinflated	N
the	N
inner	C
tube	N
.	N

After	N
reassembling	N
everything	N
,	N
I	N
sat	N
on	N
the	N
bike	N
and	N
tested	N
it	N
out	N
.	N

Good	N
as	N
new	N
!	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
go	N
for	N
a	N
bike	N
ride	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
went	N
out	N
to	N
the	N
garage	N
to	N
get	N
my	N
bike	N
.	N

I	N
brought	N
it	N
out	N
to	N
the	N
driveway	N
and	N
got	N
on	N
.	N

I	N
noticed	N
that	N
something	N
did	N
n't	N
feel	N
right	N
.	N

It	N
was	N
too	N
hard	N
to	N
pedal	C
.	N

I	N
looked	N
down	N
and	N
noticed	N
that	N
my	N
front	N
tire	C
was	N
flat	N
.	N

I	N
went	N
back	N
into	N
the	N
garage	N
and	N
brought	N
out	N
my	N
bicycle	N
pump	N
.	N

I	N
removed	N
the	N
cover	N
from	N
the	N
air	N
valve	N
and	N
attached	N
the	N
pump	N
to	N
it	N
.	N

I	N
pumped	N
up	N
and	N
down	N
on	N
the	N
handle	N
a	N
few	N
times	C
and	N
noticed	N
that	N
the	N
air	N
was	N
not	N
staying	N
in	N
.	N

I	N
went	N
back	N
into	N
the	N
garage	N
,	N
again	N
,	N
and	N
this	N
time	N
I	N
brought	N
out	N
my	N
bicycle	N
repair	N
kit	N
.	N

I	N
found	C
the	N
hole	N
in	N
my	N
tire	C
,	N
put	N
a	N
patch	C
on	N
,	N
and	N
then	N
filled	N
the	N
tire	C
with	N
air	N
.	N

The	N
patch	C
seemed	N
to	N
be	N
nice	N
and	N
sturdy	N
and	N
I	N
believed	N
it	N
was	N
going	N
to	N
hold	N
.	N

I	N
put	N
the	N
air	N
pump	N
and	N
the	N
bicycle	N
tire	C
patch	C
kit	N
back	N
into	N
the	N
garage	N
,	N
put	N
on	N
my	N
helmet	C
,	N
and	N
rode	N
my	N
bicycle	N
down	N
the	N
street	N
.	N

I	N
was	N
riding	N
my	N
bike	N
yesterday	N
and	N
somehow	N
I	N
must	N
have	N
run	N
over	N
something	N
and	N
punctured	N
the	N
front	N
tire	C
of	N
my	N
bike	N
.	N

I	N
measured	N
my	N
tire	C
height	N
and	N
wrote	N
down	N
my	N
model	N
of	N
my	N
bike	N
before	N
I	N
wen	N
to	N
the	N
bike	N
shop	N
to	N
buy	N
a	N
new	N
inner	C
tube	N
.	N

I	N
go	N
to	N
the	N
bike	N
shop	N
and	N
the	N
man	N
behind	N
the	N
counter	C
asked	N
what	N
I	N
needed	N
help	N
with	N
.	N

I	N
explained	N
I	N
needed	N
a	N
new	N
inner	C
tube	N
for	N
my	N
bike	N
since	N
I	N
had	N
gotten	N
a	N
flat	N
tire	C
.	N

I	N
showed	N
him	N
the	N
model	N
number	N
and	N
the	N
tire	C
height	N
an	N
d	N
he	N
quickly	N
went	N
a	N
got	N
the	N
inner	C
tube	N
I	N
needed	N
.	N

I	N
payed	N
for	N
my	N
purchase	C
,	N
thank	N
the	N
man	N
and	N
went	N
home	N
to	N
fix	N
my	N
bike	N
.	N

I	N
took	N
the	N
front	N
tire	C
off	N
and	N
gently	C
pried	N
the	N
outer	C
tire	C
off	N
.	N

The	N
inner	C
tube	N
is	N
sort	N
of	N
pliable	N
so	N
I	N
stretched	N
it	N
over	N
and	N
off	N
of	N
the	N
rim	N
.	N

I	N
took	N
the	N
new	N
inner	C
tube	N
and	N
stretched	N
it	N
on	N
the	N
metal	N
rim	N
,	N
making	N
sure	N
the	N
stem	N
when	N
you	N
inflate	N
the	N
tire	C
was	N
lined	N
up	N
with	N
the	N
hole	N
on	N
the	N
metal	N
rim	N
.	N

I	N
replaced	N
the	N
outer	C
tire	C
and	N
re-inflated	N
the	N
tire	C
with	N
my	N
bicycle	N
pump	N
.	N

Now	N
I	N
can	N
ride	N
my	N
bike	N
again	N
!	N
''	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
go	N
shopping	N
downtown	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
the	N
public	N
bus	N
.	N

I	N
waited	N
at	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
where	N
other	N
people	N
were	N
also	N
waiting	N
.	N

The	N
bus	N
came	N
right	N
on	N
time	N
and	N
pulled	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
curb	C
.	N

I	N
waited	N
for	N
the	N
people	N
getting	N
off	N
the	N
bus	N
to	N
step	N
down	N
.	N

Then	N
I	N
waited	N
in	N
line	N
as	N
each	N
person	N
got	N
on	N
.	N

When	N
it	N
was	N
my	N
turn	N
I	N
stepped	N
up	N
the	N
few	N
steps	N
into	N
front	N
of	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N

I	N
swiped	N
my	N
bus	N
card	N
to	N
pay	N
,	N
smiled	N
at	N
the	N
driver	N
,	N
and	N
chose	N
a	N
seat	N
.	N

The	N
bus	N
was	N
a	N
little	N
crowded	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
stood	N
and	N
held	N
onto	N
the	N
bar	N
.	N

An	N
elderly	N
woman	N
got	N
on	N
the	N
bus	N
next	N
,	N
and	N
a	N
younger	N
person	N
got	N
up	N
to	N
give	N
her	N
his	N
seat	N
.	N

When	N
everyone	N
was	N
on	N
,	N
the	N
bus	N
put	N
on	N
his	N
turn	N
signal	C
and	N
pulled	N
back	N
into	N
the	N
street	N
.	N

As	N
I	N
got	N
closer	N
to	N
my	N
stop	N
,	N
I	N
pulled	N
the	N
cord	N
.	N

The	N
cord	N
dinged	N
to	N
signal	C
that	N
I	N
wanted	N
to	N
get	N
off	N
.	N

The	N
bus	N
pulled	N
into	N
the	N
stop	N
where	N
other	N
people	N
were	N
waiting	N
to	N
get	N
on	N
.	N

They	N
waited	N
until	N
I	N
got	N
off	N
before	N
boarding	N
.	N

Last	N
Saturday	N
,	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
visit	N
a	N
friend	N
in	N
the	N
hospital	N
.	N

I	N
own	N
a	N
car	N
,	N
but	N
it	N
's	N
been	N
acting	N
up	N
lately	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
take	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N

I	N
set	N
out	N
from	N
my	N
apartment	N
with	N
a	N
spring	N
in	N
my	N
step	N
,	N
because	N
it	N
was	N
an	N
amazing	N
day	N
.	N

I	N
walked	N
through	N
my	N
apartment	N
complex	C
's	N
parking	N
lot	N
to	N
reach	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
,	N
where	N
I	N
waited	N
for	N
the	N
bus	N
around	N
5	N
minutes	N
.	N

When	N
it	N
came	N
to	N
a	N
stop	N
in	N
front	N
of	N
me	N
,	N
I	N
boarded	N
and	N
put	N
a	N
$	N
1	N
bill	N
and	N
2	N
quarters	N
in	N
the	N
fare	N
machine	N
.	N

I	N
selected	N
a	N
seat	N
near	N
the	N
entrance	N
,	N
because	N
it	N
has	N
more	N
space	N
and	N
fewer	N
people	N
.	N

Riding	N
the	N
bus	N
often	N
gives	N
me	N
motion	C
sickness	C
,	N
so	N
I	N
closed	N
my	N
eyes	N
and	N
tried	N
to	N
ignore	C
the	N
swaying	N
motion	C
as	N
it	N
rolled	N
down	N
the	N
street	N
.	N

Behind	N
me	N
,	N
two	N
college	N
students	N
were	N
eagerly	C
discussing	N
a	N
class	N
project	N
.	N

In	N
the	N
very	N
back	N
,	N
a	N
small	N
child	N
was	N
loudly	N
pretending	N
to	N
be	N
a	N
dinosaur	N
.	N

I	N
was	N
glad	N
when	N
I	N
finally	N
reached	N
my	N
destination	N
.	N

I	N
pulled	N
the	N
cord	N
signaling	N
that	N
I	N
would	N
need	N
the	N
bus	N
to	N
stop	N
next	N
to	N
the	N
hospital	N
,	N
and	N
got	N
up	N
to	N
exit	N
out	N
the	N
bus	N
's	N
side	N
door	N
.	N

Fresh	N
air	N
never	N
smelled	N
so	N
good	N
!	N
I	N
needed	N
to	N
get	N
to	N
the	N
craft	C
store	N
,	N
there	N
was	N
a	N
sale	C
!	N
Unfortunately	N
,	N
husband	N
had	N
the	N
car	N
and	N
he	N
would	N
be	N
gone	N
a	N
while	N
.	N

I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N

I	N
made	N
sure	N
I	N
had	N
a	N
couple	N
dollars	N
for	N
the	N
fare	N
and	N
walked	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
.	N

I	N
waited	N
about	N
ten	N
minutes	N
,	N
then	N
the	N
bus	N
came	N
around	N
the	N
corner	N
and	N
stopped	N
at	N
the	N
bench	C
I	N
was	N
sitting	N
.	N

A	N
few	N
people	N
got	N
off	N
the	N
bus	N
and	N
I	N
stepped	N
through	N
the	N
doors	N
onto	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N

I	N
smiled	N
at	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
and	N
put	N
the	N
money	N
into	N
the	N
machine	N
to	N
pay	N
for	N
my	N
ride	N
.	N

I	N
took	N
a	N
seat	N
at	N
an	N
open	N
place	N
and	N
looked	N
out	N
the	N
window	N
.	N

The	N
store	N
I	N
was	N
going	N
to	N
was	N
only	N
a	N
few	N
stops	N
away	N
and	N
when	N
I	N
saw	N
we	N
were	N
close	N
,	N
I	N
pulled	N
the	N
cord	N
to	N
signal	C
to	N
the	N
driver	N
I	N
was	N
ready	N
to	N
get	N
off	N
.	N

He	N
stopped	N
at	N
the	N
shopping	N
center	N
and	N
I	N
thanked	N
him	N
for	N
the	N
ride	N
as	N
I	N
stepped	N
onto	N
the	N
pavement	N
.	N

Yesterday	N
,	N
I	N
went	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
.	N

I	N
waited	N
for	N
the	N
bus	N
with	N
a	N
few	N
others	N
.	N

The	N
bus	N
arrived	N
.	N

When	N
I	N
got	N
on	N
,	N
I	N
scanned	N
my	N
bus	N
pass	N
on	N
the	N
bus	N
pass	N
scanner	N
and	N
then	N
took	N
my	N
seat	N
.	N

The	N
bus	N
was	N
not	N
crowded	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
was	N
able	C
to	N
take	N
a	N
seat	N
near	N
the	N
front	N
.	N

I	N
sat	N
quietly	N
,	N
playing	N
with	N
my	N
cellphone	N
.	N

Others	N
stared	N
around	N
or	N
talked	N
quietly	N
amongst	C
themselves	N
.	N

A	N
bell	N
rang	N
every	N
few	N
blocks	N
to	N
indicate	C
someone	N
wanting	N
to	N
get	N
off	N
.	N

The	N
bus	N
would	N
stop	N
,	N
let	N
people	N
off	N
,	N
and	N
let	N
new	N
people	N
on	N
.	N

The	N
bus	N
started	N
to	N
get	N
crowded	N
so	N
I	N
offered	N
my	N
seat	N
to	N
an	N
older	N
woman	N
.	N

She	N
thanked	N
me	N
for	N
the	N
polite	N
etiquette	N
.	N

I	N
saw	N
my	N
stop	N
coming	N
up	N
,	N
so	N
I	N
pulled	N
the	N
lever	N
and	N
the	N
bell	N
rang	N
again	N
.	N

The	N
bus	N
stopped	N
a	N
few	N
moments	N
later	N
.	N

I	N
thanked	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
for	N
his	N
services	N
and	N
exited	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N

Today	N
,	N
I	N
had	N
to	N
ride	N
the	N
bus	N
home	N
from	N
the	N
market	N
.	N

I	N
walked	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
to	N
wait	N
for	N
the	N
next	N
bus	N
.	N

It	N
was	N
supposed	N
to	N
arrive	N
in	N
10	N
minutes	N
.	N

When	N
the	N
bus	N
pulled	N
up	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
where	N
I	N
was	N
waiting	N
,	N
I	N
stood	N
up	N
and	N
walked	N
over	N
to	N
curb	C
.	N

The	N
bus	N
driver	N
opened	N
the	N
bus	N
doors	N
and	N
I	N
stepped	N
up	N
into	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N

I	N
had	N
to	N
hand	N
my	N
money	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
so	N
that	N
I	N
could	N
ride	N
.	N

Once	N
the	N
driver	N
took	N
my	N
money	N
,	N
I	N
walked	N
down	N
the	N
aisle	N
to	N
find	N
a	N
seat	N
.	N

There	N
were	N
many	N
seats	N
available	N
so	N
I	N
picked	N
one	N
beside	N
an	N
older	N
lady	N
that	N
looked	N
like	N
my	N
grandmother	N
.	N

She	N
was	N
very	N
nice	N
and	N
talked	N
to	N
me	N
while	N
we	N
rode	N
down	N
the	N
street	N
.	N

Once	N
the	N
bus	N
stopped	N
down	N
the	N
street	N
from	N
my	N
house	N
,	N
I	N
got	N
off	N
and	N
walked	N
down	N
the	N
sidewalk	N
to	N
my	N
house	N
.	N

I	N
was	N
very	N
glad	N
to	N
be	N
home	N
.	N

I	N
love	N
to	N
ride	N
the	N
bus	N
in	N
my	N
town	N
.	N

The	N
fare	N
is	N
only	N
75	N
cents	N
.	N

It	N
will	N
take	N
you	N
anywhere	N
.	N

On	N
Saturdays	N
I	N
get	N
up	N
early	N
and	N
walk	N
down	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
.	N

I	N
wait	N
for	N
the	N
bus	N
to	N
come	N
at	N
8:15	N
.	N

I	N
climb	N
up	N
the	N
stairs	N
and	N
drop	N
my	N
fare	N
into	N
the	N
collection	N
box	N
and	N
say	N
hello	N
to	N
the	N
driver	N
.	N

Before	N
the	N
bus	N
starts	N
up	N
again	N
I	N
move	N
all	N
the	N
way	N
to	N
the	N
back	N
to	N
sit	N
in	N
the	N
last	N
row	N
of	N
seats	N
.	N

Lots	N
of	N
different	N
people	N
get	N
on	N
.	N

Some	N
with	N
shopping	N
bags	N
,	N
others	N
all	N
dressed	N
up	N
and	N
some	N
like	N
me	N
dressed	N
casual	N
for	N
a	N
summer	N
morning	N
.	N

I	N
take	N
the	N
bus	N
all	N
the	N
way	N
until	N
it	N
gets	N
to	N
the	N
center	N
of	N
town	N
where	N
I	N
get	N
off	N
.	N

Before	N
i	N
get	N
off	N
I	N
get	N
a	N
transfer	N
ticket	N
.	N

And	N
then	N
the	N
fun	N
begins	N
.	N

I	N
look	N
at	N
the	N
bus	N
route	N
map	N
at	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
and	N
look	N
for	N
a	N
part	N
of	N
the	N
city	N
i	N
want	N
to	N
explore	N
.	N

For	N
75	N
cents	N
i	N
can	N
get	N
to	N
any	N
part	N
of	N
my	N
city	N
.	N

I	N
see	N
all	N
kinds	N
of	N
people	N
and	N
get	N
to	N
explore	N
the	N
city	N
I	N
live	N
in	N
.	N

This	N
morning	N
I	N
rode	N
a	N
public	N
bus	N
to	N
college	N
.	N

Before	N
I	N
left	N
my	N
house	N
,	N
I	N
checked	N
the	N
bus	N
schedule	C
so	N
I	N
would	N
know	N
what	N
time	N
the	N
bus	N
was	N
meant	N
to	N
arrive	N
.	N

I	N
then	N
left	N
my	N
house	N
and	N
walked	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
right	N
outside	N
my	N
house	N
.	N

I	N
then	N
sat	N
on	N
the	N
bench	C
next	N
to	N
an	N
old	N
man	N
and	N
waited	N
for	N
the	N
bus	N
to	N
arrive	N
.	N

While	N
I	N
waited	N
,	N
I	N
chatted	N
with	N
the	N
old	N
man	N
.	N

When	N
the	N
bus	N
arrived	N
,	N
I	N
let	N
the	N
old	N
man	N
get	N
on	N
in	N
front	N
of	N
me	N
.	N

I	N
then	N
climbed	N
on	N
board	N
the	N
bus	N
,	N
paid	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
the	N
bus	N
fare	N
,	N
and	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
said	N
``	N
``	N
Good	N
morning	N
``	N
``	N
as	N
he	N
handed	N
me	N
my	N
ticket	N
.	N

Holding	N
onto	N
my	N
ticket	N
,	N
I	N
took	N
a	N
seat	N
near	N
the	N
front	N
of	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N

I	N
stared	N
out	N
the	N
window	N
throughout	C
the	N
bus	N
journey	N
,	N
just	N
enjoying	N
the	N
view	N
.	N

When	N
my	N
stop	N
was	N
coming	N
up	N
,	N
I	N
pressed	N
the	N
button	N
to	N
let	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
know	N
to	N
stop	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N

He	N
stopped	N
at	N
my	N
stop	N
and	N
I	N
stood	N
up	N
and	N
got	N
off	N
the	N
bus	N
,	N
thanking	N
the	N
bus	N
driver	N
before	N
I	N
exited	N
.	N

I	N
wanted	N
to	N
go	N
to	N
San	N
Francisco	N
from	N
my	N
home	N
in	N
San	N
Jose	N
and	N
I	N
did	N
n't	N
feel	N
like	N
driving	N
.	N

I	N
looked	N
online	N
and	N
found	C
a	N
bus	N
route	N
from	N
here	N
to	N
there	N
that	N
was	N
leaving	N
in	N
just	N
about	N
30	N
minutes	N
.	N

I	N
walked	N
out	N
of	N
my	N
house	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
and	N
got	N
on	N
it	N
.	N

It	N
was	N
a	N
very	N
empty	N
bus	N
and	N
I	N
stared	N
out	N
of	N
the	N
window	N
at	N
the	N
scenery	N
.	N

The	N
bus	N
driver	N
was	N
very	N
nice	N
and	N
asked	N
me	N
how	N
my	N
day	N
was	N
.	N

We	N
spoke	N
for	N
the	N
whole	N
entire	C
ride	N
and	N
after	N
a	N
short	N
time	N
,	N
we	N
arrived	N
into	N
San	N
Francisco	N
.	N

It	N
was	N
very	N
pleasant	N
not	N
having	N
to	N
drive	N
and	N
it	N
was	N
a	N
very	N
smooth	N
ride	N
on	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N

Luckily	N
,	N
there	N
was	N
n't	N
much	N
traffic	N
so	N
we	N
got	N
there	N
in	N
a	N
very	N
short	N
time	N
frame	N
.	N

After	N
getting	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
,	N
the	N
driver	N
opened	N
his	N
doors	N
for	N
me	N
and	N
wished	N
me	N
a	N
great	N
day	N
.	N

I	N
did	N
the	N
same	N
and	N
stepped	N
off	N
of	N
the	N
bus	N
.	N

it	N
was	N
a	N
very	N
easy	N
and	N
fun	N
experience	N
.	N

Yesterday	N
I	N
decided	N
to	N
take	N
the	N
bus	N
to	N
the	N
zoo	N
.	N

I	N
walked	N
over	N
to	N
the	N
bus	N
stop	N
and	N
sat	N
down	N
on	N
the	N
bench	C
while	N
I	N
waited	N
for	N
the	N
bus	N
to	N
arrive	N
.	N
