# Complex Word Identification as a Sequence Labelling Task

# Usage

Additional functions for the CWI models are available in [complex_labeller.py](./sequence-labeler-master/complex_labeller.py). Please refer to the [example notebook](example.ipynb) for details on how to use the models. The  original code for the sequence labeller used in this project can be found at https://github.com/marekrei/sequence-labeler.

# Dataset

The dataset used to train these models was collected by Yimam et al., (2018) and is available [here](https://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/lt/resources/data/complex-word-identification-dataset.html).
